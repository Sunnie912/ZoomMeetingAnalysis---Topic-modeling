The project was to build a web application that took in as an input meeting transcript data and output the topics that were discussed in this meeting. With the proliferation of online meeting data, we think there is useful data for an organization to gain insights into their organizations from their meeting transcripts now that they are mostly virtual meetings. We built a program that analyzes meeting transcripts and weights which topics were discussed in the meeting. A user can go to our website, input the text string into the input module and our website will return the weights of how much each topic was discussed. We focused on the model development more than the user interface, but we think this can easily be extended to an application that programmatically aggregates topics across many meetings to see what is trending within your organization which would be useful information for executive and management teams.
