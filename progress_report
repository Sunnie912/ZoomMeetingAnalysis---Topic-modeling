1) Which tasks have been completed?
Finalize datasets, libraries to be used to extract topics. We decided to use nltk, gensim and spacy for implementation. 

Training Data and selection. We decided to use the AMI meeting transcript corpus to train our data and to test on self-generated transcripts.

Model experimentation and training. We experimented with a selection of modes including LDA, NMF and PLSA (see difference). We selected the LDA algorithm with bag-of- words and tf-idf for topic assignment based on it performing the best on our training data set. 

 2) Which tasks are pending? 
Model fine-tuning. Adjust the parameters of the model we selected.

Build a user interface for the model.

Test our model and program on self-generated transcripts.

Iterate after training. 

3) Are you facing any challenges? 
Availability of data sets was a challenge and we are relying on self-generated transcripts to complete a task. 

Reducing overfitting problem of the algorithms.
