all right what's going on everybody
welcome back to another episode of the
waveform podcast we're your hosts i'm
marquez and i'm andrew
and today let's see we're going to talk
about the teslaplat event i feel like
i've got a lot of thoughts on that and
what elon tweeted before and all the
announcements in the car itself
but also we've got windows 11 leaks and
everyone's favorite social media
platform
making a watch maybe a facebook watch
might have some rants about that
yeah maybe first though adam found this
really cool website and it's
ranks the most used internet browsers
and at first i was like
cool i i'm gonna know everything this
says okay i was actually like
really surprised by some of the results
yeah you mentioned this to me and i'm
trying to figure out what you mean by
that
so first i want to just say it you can
check it out in a couple different ways
you can like do based on desktop or
mobile or everything like that but if
we're just
assuming all platforms here what if you
had to guess
what do you think is the most popular
internet browser okay is this worldwide
worldwide worldwide all platforms most
use internet browser so just the way i
think about that
is when you said most use internet
browser i'm like what's everyone's
default on their phone yep that's right
and most people on the iphone are using
safari
and but there's way more android phones
and i guess most of those are using
chrome
and then desktop desktop might be a
little bit an
odd one to predict because there's a lot
of people using older browsers who just
don't care
um so okay most
popular worldwide all platforms
worldwide number one i would guess
is chrome okay thanks to android
number two i would
guess is safari because of the iphone
okay do you want to guess number three
real quick
that's tough one third is actually
really close between a couple but
i i only know so many browsers i know
about firefox and i know about opera and
i know about
some older ones like maxthon and
there's even some privacy focus like
brave browser and things like that
you're missing one really obviously i
mean internet explorer
and edge exist because people just use
the default
on windows yeah or does that make it
number five i mean i guess it still gets
a use case so it still gets
used and like you said it's a default
maybe it is number three
i'm gonna go internet explorer
okay number three well we're going to
call it edge because internet explorer
is not really a thing anymore right um
yeah you're right but do you want to go
ahead and open up that link okay yeah
finally open it up because i think you
may be surprised at the percentages of
it
this is 64 chrome
wow 18 safari and then edge is all the
way down at 3.37
followed by firefox 3.36 and then
samsung internet and opera around three
and two
wow is now is that because of the
dominance of android
well like i was trying to figure this
out and it is cool in a second we're
gonna go down and we're gonna click
through a couple of these different um
there's like you can sort it by just
desktop oh i want to do that and and one
was
the tablet one is really interesting so
i was trying to think of this
my first thought was like you said there
are way more androids in the world and i
just
as a pixel user i'm just assuming it's
chrome as the default but
then i see over here samsung internet so
is sam samsung internet is the default
internet browser for samsung phones
right true so
you kind of can't count it as while i'm
sure a lot of people especially
listening to this podcast probably
install chrome on their samsung phone i
know i used to
i bet a lot i bet the majority of them
are using samsung internet
right and is that does that not fall
onto chrome then even if it's like
chromium-based it would be like
samsung internet i mean i don't know
enough about it but i'm assuming if it's
listed here it's probably
okay it's own thing i was just surprised
at how
but because of how many iphones and
because of how many macs there are and
because of how many ipads there are i
thought safari would be at least like
30 in second place i mean i thought it'd
be way closer
yeah 18 of worldwide is pretty good but
i would expect a little higher
from all those iphones and i also
definitely expected edge
to be higher because it's just the
default on all windows systems so that
means
i mean if that doesn't tell you how bad
edges
or how little confidence people have in
internet explorer which is now edge
i don't know what to tell you anymore
because there's
obviously more than three percent of the
market share of windows computers
out there the the tablet one is
interesting the tablet one's the coolest
the tablet one has a char they all have
a chart and i found this interesting
because
currently we have chrome at 46 percent
safari at 40 um for tablets
but the chart has a history where safari
was at 50 percent i didn't actually look
at that and has crossed
under and lost and conceded first place
recently in march like
two months ago so that that's pretty
interesting but again
is that because ipads have stopped
growing and
you've just gotten more and more random
android tablets out there in the world
running chrome or are they just
switching to chrome on the ipad i don't
know
my guess would be that ipad has just
dominated for so long that's why i
was ahead and now like you said i don't
know if ipad
sales are growing as fast as android
sales are because
lots of people haven't found an android
tablet that they love and
more and more are coming out and more
and more have potential to be
a good android tablet whereas we've had
a great
apple tablet for so long yeah um it does
i am
a little surprised when you go to mobile
let's see mobile still is like
i thought safari would be higher but i
guess this is worldwide if we switch you
can switch this to us
yeah in the us i bet it's way higher
let's see
so i go to mobile and then i go to
united states of america
goes ahead 54 there you go
so that would that would that would
literally just be a count of like
most people on the iphone using safari
as their default lots of people use
chrome on the iphone by the way
but yeah just the overall default you
can expect to dominate
and then chrome being 38 uh that's going
to be a lot of people on android phones
shout out to
samsung internet pulling in third place
at 4.5
there it is it's in its own category
followed by firefox
and opera pulls up a half a percent so i
guess when you
if you switch to desktop browser edge
does go up to 11
so i guess that makes more sense i still
think that feels low which is pretty
surprising
um oh wait that's 11 in just u.s
man there's so many options you can do i
kind of wish i could pick every single
thing
that wasn't the u.s and base it on that
remove the
on desktop edge is only eight percent
not even 10
i'm i'm happy about that yeah that's
right i was thinking sorry isn't even 10
when you initially asked me what's the
most popular browser i immediately went
oh my god it's probably internet
explorer it's probably edge it's
probably number one because people just
don't
have you know there's tons of people out
there who don't change
but there are way more mobile users of
internet browsers
out there period there's lots of people
who have phones that don't have a
desktop or a laptop this really just
shows
that and it always i always know it but
it always surprises me
how big that percentage is and um i
think one last thing i want to say on
here is as a firefox user it
kills me to see edge above firefox
and it makes me feel like a little
hipster it's an enthusiast browser
which i don't get why i use it because i
wouldn't consider myself the enthusiast
that would take advantage of it but
my boss when i did it just also used it
so i just started using it and i've
loved it since then and uh
yeah kind of sad to see it so low have
you tried chrome on desktop you just
don't want yeah no i used to use chrome
all the time i
just i think it came to a point where my
boss was using it and i was just
watching my ram
just get eaten by chrome i don't know if
that's a
fixed or just still like a meme i know i
see the meme all the time it's still
half true
okay yeah but yeah firefox has just
worked really well for me so i've just
gotten used to it and kept using
word well speaking of
yeah this is too hard of a segue
speaking of
huge companies making products that not
everybody wants
speaking of the facebook watch have you
heard about the facebook
yeah yeah okay well there's a rumor i'll
just just
just to give some background to people
there's this is literally just a rumor i
don't think there's any
uh official information there's not
really any much
credible leaks but there's a rumor that
facebook
may be working on a smart watch
uh with some cameras in it oh i didn't
oh i mean why can't why wouldn't it have
a camera two cameras and a facebook
smart watch
so you remember facebook portal right
yes okay
that i mean facebook's reputation uh
as a social network is one thing but
facebook's reputation as a company
is not the best especially when it comes
to privacy
and information and data arguably the
worst when it comes to people
it's not great yeah it's not great so
when you hear facebook making a smart
watch
that uh they they did actually try to
make a smartphone
a couple years ago by the way the
cha-cha it it was with htc
i now remember it it was awful it
there's no reason to remember it i'm not
shocked that you don't remember
it was one of the fastest discontinued
products of all time
i think i might have made a video about
like the fastest discontinued products
before the cha
cha and this like took the throne really
yeah it was like three months or
something crazy like that
but um yeah i wasn't shocked when that
failed but when you hear facebook okay
they might make a smart watch you think
okay it's kind of along the same lines
of like an unnecessary piece of hardware
it's an accessory to an android phone
why would i want the facebook version
and then the one fact that just keeps
getting attached to this smartwatch
rumor
is that it might have cameras on it i'm
reading a little bit right now it says
camera on the front uh exists primarily
for video calling while a 1080p
autofocus camera on the back what is the
back of a watch
first of all um it can be used for
capturing footage when detached from the
stainless steel frame on the right so
literally the back
so you would so you would i don't know
about shooting video like this
i can't what i cannot wait to see
people walking around in like doors
places that's really
holding their watch straps
trying to take photos of things i
imagined okay i imagine for the for the
audio only listeners i imagine it's on
your wrist and the top of the watch that
faces away from you would be like your
camera to face away from you and you
take videos of
almost like you uh like the sony
mirrorless cameras where you can flip
the screen up
vertically so you're looking down on it
while it's facing forward so
it's a 90 degree angle from the view
you're looking at yeah that would make
sense
it would make sense functionally it's
just stupid anyway because no one would
use it yeah
you can by the way use the apple watch
as a viewfinder for your iphone
so you can open the camera app on the
watch
and it literally just opens the camera
on the iphone and you can use it as a
viewfinder and can you tap shutter on
that yeah you can shut her on the watch
it'll take a photo on the phone but
cameras living on the watch feels like
number one it's going to look weird
maybe a little clunky you're already
trying to minimize bezels on a smart
watch that's
typically the form factor you want to go
for on a higher end smartwatch and if
this is a
a dual camera smartwatch design that
just doesn't seem like it's going to
look any good
i'll give them like facetime calling
like
okay sure that might actually be
something like maybe you're
just like quickly at the store and you
want to like i still don't get why
people facetime like at the store
or at the gym always really confuses me
but yeah i'll give it that
facebook is attempting to connect people
through video with portal like we saw so
this would be another one the camera on
the back
just it makes no sense but i cannot wait
to see people in the wild
i'm trying to picture filming with it
yeah
i don't i see i do see lots of face
times just like out
in the like the gym locker room before
i've seen it in the gym i've seen it
i've seen people driving while face
timing yeah that's a huge
if anyone does that on this podcast i'm
very upset with you i'm disappointed
i've i've seen that through people's
windows i've seen people facetiming just
walking around in the streets which is
it could happen i guess that's fine but
um
there is almost no reason i can think of
why someone would want
the camera to be on their wrist and by
facebook of all kinds exactly i think
that's what the next thing we're kind of
getting at here is like
if there's i have not seen anyone really
use the portal
and i think we all know why because why
would you just voluntarily put a camera
and microphone
connected to facebook in your home now
why would you take it one step closer
and just put it on your wrist and now is
potentially tracking
all your health stuff as well like am i
gonna start getting blood pressure
medication
on my facebook ads if i start wearing
this or like
that feels like a invasion of privacy
but if
we all know facebook's motto it's pretty
much where invading your privacy yeah
like if you if you go all the way to the
extreme like if facebook could have it
their way
they they announce a watch it's got
sensors on it cameras on it connects to
your facebook account
you know how like the oculus quest you
need a facebook you needed a facebook
account
um this would be the same way like you
need a facebook account you have this
watch
and then it would just sell
it would just give all your information
back to facebook to help target ads
better and make a better facebook
product that if they could have it their
way i'm sure that's what happened
you would start getting ads based on
like things the watch notices about you
things you've said around the watch i'm
just imagining
like every weird uh like medicine
commercial we're used to seeing in the
u.s and just like
now that coming up and being like does
my watch know something i don't why am i
getting ads for
like high blood pressure or something
like that i was just thinking about this
also this is one of the one of the most
impressive things about the apple watch
is how much it knows about you
and doesn't relay back to apple like
there's a bunch of locally collected
information and a bunch of like apple
values privacy at least
in that way where they'll keep a bunch
of stuff on device um
but this watch knows a lot about me with
all the sensors and all the heart rate
information and
the exact times that i go to sleep and
wake up every day and like all this
you know you know blood glucose
measuring is one of the rumors they're
gonna have all these other sensors in
the watch and it just knows so much
about me
that if apple decided to flip a switch
on privacy and just was like you know
what we're just gonna sell all this
information
they would have a lot of information
yeah i i don't know how much they could
do with all that
well i'm sure they could do plenty with
it yeah i don't know i don't know how to
feel about that
but this kind of leads me to a little
fun question i have also a quick point
yeah
the the hipaa stuff you're not allowed
to share
uh public or you're not allowed to share
uh health information about people
that you collect if it is a certain type
of health information because that's
the way health information works uh
unless you sign that stuff away
willingly
which i feel like could very easily be
tossed into terms of service that
you accept maybe who knows yeah we're
we're clearly speculating here so don't
take anything
yeah as uh take it with a grant this is
not medical advice this is definitely
not medical or
lo or legal advice you are trying to
collect people's data or financial
advice
um but we had a quick little question or
like a couple of us were saying like
what would you have like how good would
the facebook watch have to be
for you to be okay with wearing
something made by facebook on your wrist
all the time
because like we always talk about apple
watch is just so far ahead
there aren't a lot of android watches i
mean yes there are android watches that
people like
but i think we can all agree there's not
one
over the top clear winner android one
there's no match
to the apple watch exactly so what would
this have to do for you to be like hi
mark okay are we assuming it has to have
the cameras on it
do you want to take the cameras off i'm
just yeah let's assume it has to have
the cameras on it because like
you're we're saying how good does this
have to be for basically you'd have a
total invasion of privacy
yeah basically uh um if i just go right
to the top
and it's literally an apple watch made
by facebook with two cameras on it i
still wouldn't want it
and like pairs equally as well with all
of your yeah products
the apple watch exists and i would just
pick that over this ever so this has to
be something better than the output it
has to be
better than the apple watch in some way
it would have to have like
i don't know like some insane highly
technical like maybe the battery life is
a month
and it does all the stuff the apple
watch does super responsive
i just don't i don't think there's
anything they can do to make me want
this smartwatch it's hard i think this
is this is turning more into like make
your dream smartwatch and then
still not want it because it's connected
to facebook
but i mean i think the first thing i
would want i would want it to look like
a real watch
i'd like the style aspect of it to be
better um
i would want it to be super thin but
like you said crazy battery life i still
am a little upset at how thick a lot of
smart watches are and i mean
watches are pretty thick in general as
well but batteries um
yeah batteries are thick it's hard but
again i really don't want facebook on my
wrist either so
yeah let's make it hard for you yeah i
think it's it's probably not going to be
yeah facebook if you're listening take a
lot of notes
on what happened to the cha-cha just
remember that remember
i'm sure they will never forget that
yeah but yeah i think the
the biggest thing here is i cannot wait
to see people filming with their watch
that sounds hilarious there needs to be
an instagram page dedicated to like
people of walmart but people filming
with a facebook watch i
i'd follow that in a heartbeat i hate it
uh we were going to talk about windows 8
a little bit
that is windows 11.
talk about internet explorer um yeah no
windows 11 has gotten leaked a little
bit we're going to
we're expecting to see officially
windows 11 stuff pretty soon june 24th i
think is their event okay so it's coming
right up
but uh do you have any thoughts on what
we've seen so far
yeah i'll describe it quickly because
like i mean
people have almost the full version
there's a couple things not quite
working but i think the main difference
we see
and with most browsers is like how does
it look on your desktop like what has
changed there
and the main thing they've done here is
cleaning up the toolbar on the bottom
and centering it
and then when you hit that start menu
the start menu is now
also centered and it's it's pinned apps
it's all app based kind of on the top
and then at the bottom has a couple
recent files recent folders stuff like
that um so it's
it's much different and it very much is
kind of going along the same design
pattern as like mac os or chrome os
which is just center based big app
buttons
it it feels like it's going more towards
like almost a mobile platform
i don't know why centering it bothers me
so much it does
luckily you can go back to left the line
okay
for me windows i'm just so used to left
align and like
maybe that's the old person in me i'm
sure most people who like windows like
it well
everyone's used to it every version has
it's always always been left alone
always always always been like that as
far as i can remember um and
yeah it looks weird in the middle to me
but maybe that's just me not being ready
for change
um i've always i've always kind of liked
that windows felt a little more like
file based and a little less
user-friendly but if we're being honest
that's because we're nerds and most
people would probably enjoy this better
it's much it's much easier it's much
cleaner
apps are like super big and easy to see
and they're all just right in the middle
so
i get it yeah to me honestly desktop
os's have always been
and probably always should be pretty
boring like i
i do my file management and i move
things around and i use the programs but
the os itself
doesn't really need to do that much for
me it just needs to look good and clean
and simple and work the way i
intuitively expect it to
like mac os versus windows to me
is not that exciting of a debate because
i could i could use either
yeah it's just like do you move the
window controls to the left or the right
like do you move the menu bar to the top
or keep it on the window
like small details are are sort of
minimal but
at the end of the day it's about the
programs i'm running on the os
that i care way more about so windows 11
is
is cool and it's exciting i'm sure for
some people i heard there's a new
startup sound
uh which is neat yeah there is one um
i'm sure adam can add that in
it's in this article we have which i'll
also post in the show notes because
that's a lot of pictures i do
there's a photo in here with it left
aligned i do think
it being back on the left side i think
it looks better than windows 10. it's a
little more compact
i like that the search bar is a button
that you press and i'm assuming expands
into the search bar rather than windows
10 just
had the search bar there already all the
time um
but i do enjoy that there's a couple
little other things there's like
some new on the maximize button some new
ways to structure windows into
pre-planned places and yep that's what
an os is
yep that's simple yeah not too much i
think there's some new xbox
console stuff on here um but yeah june
24th
should be the announcement for all of it
my favorite thing about this was um
tom warren's video where he opened up
the notifications
panel on the side and he took his mouse
and he just slid over
and just dismissed the notifications by
sliding
mac os craig take some notes baby
there are good stuff two more quick
things rounded corners
just design change and then widgets
which i
did want to talk about i actually
thought widgets weren't really a thing
anymore but i looked it up and
apparently you can do them on windows 10
but i really think vista just left such
a sour taste in everyone's mouth
that i don't know a single person that
uses windows widgets anymore
um do you remember those i do i remember
actually
really looking forward to windows vista
because wasn't that right after xp
everyone did because it was like it was
a pretty dramatic change
super dramatic change like very visually
yeah because we had xp for a while and
it was flat and it was
opaque and we had all these like very
clear well-defined
aesthetic looks and then vista was like
this translucent
like glassy thing and it was going to be
so new and fresh and modern
and so i was really looking forward to
vista i remember wanting a new gpu
just specifically so i could have this
great vista experience
uh and it was it was all right that was
right yeah it was like very
bubbly you felt like you were uh do you
know that uh
what's that board game with the in the
middle i think it's called trouble where
it has like that big
bubble with the dice inside it and you
press it okay like that's what the
buttons like the start button felt like
on vista and then the widgets were just
so
bad there was all these like 3d circular
look
terrible they've always been weird even
on uh on mac os for the longest time you
had a
dashboard thing where you could just
swipe in a bunch of widgets and they're
just you just have a calculator
and a weather widget and just a bunch of
random widgets that you could
be just great if they put that on ipad
but uh yeah
but you know desktop os keep it simple
yeah all right so let's talk about
tesla's latest event
their latest product and their latest
situation
with plaid model s and x so yeah that's
the latest
is tesla's model s and x their higher
end vehicles now have a
plaid version and they're they're both
essentially getting refreshed entirely
so there's a new long range model s l
focus on model s and
a plaid model s long range model s is
dual motor
we'll get about 400 miles of range and
we'll do
zero to 60 in 3.1 seconds i think
and then plaid model s is triple motor
and they have this immense focus
on that powertrain and that performance
and it'll do 390 miles which is pretty
dang impressive
and 0 to 60 in 1.99 seconds
asterisk we'll get to that so generally
the biggest thing actually here to me
is the interior refresh because that's
like really what happened with this car
is there's a new interior have you seen
it you've seen the
yeah i think i mean clearly the yolk is
the biggest thing it's something we all
thought
we didn't really think was gonna happen
there's definitely been past episodes
where we said we didn't think that was
gonna
actually ship with that but it is um oh
man what do i think of it
uh and isn't the other big difference
kind of it's the horizontal
screen now rather than the vertical
screen i like that a lot there's a bunch
of new stuff
i don't i'll just go down the list
honestly because there's a lot
okay um i think we'll start with the
yoke right so i've seen
so they they announced the plaid car
originally
then we got this first deliveries event
where they delivered the first 25 of
them so now they're officially out in
the wild
it's happening there's real people
driving them they have the oak wheel
and they will continue uh deliveries
from here so there's a lot of inter
interior changes that match model 3 and
model y
they've got the new ventless invisible
air conditioner system
okay they've got the new door handles
from model 3 and model y they've got the
wireless chargers
up front that are now actually built in
right under the screen and they've
switched to a horizontal screen with a
new software version
but the one thing that is definitely
different and new
and catching eyes is the yoke steering
wheel yeah and
for those who don't know what a the yoke
steering wheel is it's imagine a
steering wheel
where you sort of square it up a little
bit instead of being a totally round
wheel
and then just go ahead and chop the top
half of it off just take the top half
of that square steering wheel and just
pop it off
and that yoke that you have left that's
what's going on
not only that but there are no stocks
on the steering wheel column yeah bigger
deal than you think because that's where
your drive selector usually is
slipping switching into reverse or park
that's where your blinkers usually are
that's where your windshield wipers
usually are that's where your autopilot
select usually is that's where your
headlights usually are
all of that gone now buttons on the
steering wheel or controls on the
touchscreen
how do we feel about i mean there's a
lot of how do we feel about these
50 different things okay i'll start with
if i'm just going to go the general yoke
steering wheel
i think it clearly catches eyes it is
clearly a great
press photo it's clearly a great what
car is that what is that steering wheel
when you're walking through a parking
lot or something
awesome like looks really really cool
functionality wise
i mean i don't want to make the biggest
judgment without using it but i
cannot see myself enjoying it i think
it's going to be very hard to get used
to
i i mean there's a reason a wheel has
been on a car for so long because
there's so many points of contact when
you're making these big u-turns or
k-turns or
turning around in a parking lot or
something like that i mean for example
there's a video posted of a guy
turning literally he pulls into a
parking lot and then tries to make a
u-turn to come out
and as he's going like really awkwardly
hand over hand to try and
make the full 360 turn he's like hitting
the horn button
and like all sorts of different things
are going on and it just looks
really awkward so i believe they use
yolk steering wheels for like
f1 races but that makes sense because
the
the amount of turning they're doing
while they're doing a lot of turning
they're not doing like
really really aggressive big turns and
like full 180s 360s stuff like that yeah
the the turns you do on a racetrack are
maybe 45 degrees tops where the turns
you do in real life are much more
exaggerated um yeah very often too like
you do that
all the time i was thinking about that
as i drove here today because my natural
resting place on the steering wheel is
actually typically
sort of acceptable for a yoke but the
second i wanted to do my turns i
realized i
i moved the wheel between my hands wall
my hand i would i would have been
grabbing air basically and so i'm seeing
these videos now of that you know the
first ones are out in the wild and
there's people driving them and i'm like
this is classic tesla of
completely ignoring standards because
the only reason their standards is
because we've been doing them for so
long
the the first thing that i that comes to
mind with this is how a model 3 doesn't
have a screen behind the steering wheel
every car anyone's ever owned has had a
screen behind the steering wheel
or some way of seeing your speed behind
the steering wheel right
most of them my first car ever was a
saturn ion
and the speedometer was above the radio
in the middle
very similar to where it would be for
like a model that's hilarious
because now so the model 3 puts it over
on the right side of
your vision but the only reason
that we're all used to the steering with
the speedometer being like right behind
the steering wheel is because that's
where we've trained our glance to be
if you're looking at the road you just
train your glance to be right below
you have to leave the road to look at
your speed and look back
and i found that the more i drove model
3 and model y for that matter
the more i just trained my glance to be
45 degrees to the right instead of like
straight down so it actually didn't seem
that bad it was just this small learning
curve where
fine tesla can get away with doing
something different because it's
actually
fundamentally not that different and so
i'm thinking about this yoke like is
this going to be the same thing
where i'm just going to get used to the
buttons on the wheel
i'm gonna get used to my horn and my
blinkers and my
my headlights being buttons on the wheel
just because there were stocks before
doesn't mean they had to be stocks
they're right at your fingertips of
course it should be easier it's faster
and i i feel like i'm just gonna have to
try it to understand
i don't think there's any way for me to
watch enough videos to go oh
here's what the learning curve would be
i think i just have to drive it it's
it's way more to get used to uh like
glancing over to the right is
a much smaller easier thing to get used
to i also
weirdly found it when i used to drive my
old car like being someone who's tall
and if you sit in a position where your
steering wheel is at a certain place
if i were to have my speedometer right
in front of me i would block the
speedometer with the steering wheel
all the time because i'm like looking so
hard down um
yeah now it's well yeah but like
the yolk is so much to change like
especially people who have been driving
for years like you just get so used to i
mean how many how often do you do the
thing where you like
you spin the wheel and then you like
have your hand on the wheel and you just
kind of loosen it and it spins through
your hand
actually like at any point you can grab
it and now you're ready to go like that
is it literally impossible
on you right i know a lot of people who
do that and i
i don't personally do it but i've seen
it a lot this is
a lame driving instructor because it's
the coolest thing to do oh they they
hate when you do that though when you
do that yeah they're like don't let the
wheel oh i'm just making a bad joke
yeah yeah no they're like definitely
hold the wheel
you had a strict driving exactly i had
them do the textbook way
but i feel like the squareness of the
wheel would also hurt you sliding it
through your hands because it's
hear me yeah i a lot of times i drive
with like
one hit when i'm like on a big highway
that's straight i have like one hand
kind of at the bottom and i think the
fact that
the wheel is circular at the bottom if
i'm doing it in the middle it's very
easy to just
turn on the the point of the axis where
it's square on there
i'm sure you can do it but i feel like
it might take a little more force
because it's a little less
natural to move a square on a circular
axis than it is to move a circle on a
circular axis
right yeah and you can change the the
steering weight and all that to be
sport heavier or comfort if it's a
little lighter but
i would like to try it i think the
buttons are going to be harder to get
used to though
i that's the part that's interesting to
me i think that's going gonna be the
easiest part to get used to
i think that i've gotten so used to
driving with stocks that i just know
how to go to drive and reverse and i
know how to get my blinkers and my
wipers
and i think i'm gonna start driving a
plaid model s
and get really used to the buttons and
then going back to a regular car will
feel
weird because i have to reach further to
do all these things where i was doing
them on the screen and on the steering
wheel before
i think that's just me speculating also
wipers
screen don't like that that doesn't seem
great
yeah um but too often you have that like
in between
wipe that's just like i don't want this
on all the time but i just need like a
quick
ass i think that's what what the button
is the button's a single wipe
yes always automatic wiper other than
that i think so
okay maybe that's not as bad i don't
know i like
i like being able to control things like
that automatic stuff
usually usually isn't good it's a little
finicky yeah um
i don't know about the buttons as
someone who's like i have all my media
controls on my
on the steering wheel on my car and
generally if i want to do anything other
than like
volume up volume down i still look at it
really quickly yeah and i've had my car
for
almost 10 years at this point yeah so
like i don't know you're not using it as
much as a blinker
it still feels kind of strange i also
would kind of expect the well obviously
this doesn't happen on the stock but
a blinker left blinker on the left side
right blinker on the right side
like make it a little easier like the
most common thing should be the closest
to your thumbs on the steering wheel
so that's not the way the stocks were
it's not but that's just like one finger
up down
yeah i mean and but that goes with yeah
i guess technically i guess yeah it's
it's interesting it's just gonna be
weird
but yeah there's just so many instances
of tesla changing little things where
like i guess
we've gotten used to it a certain way
over time and this is different and it
will require a learning curve but
maybe if this is the first car you ever
drive it it
probably won't be up yeah sure that's
what they're going for is like something
along the lines of like people into it
used to this and it'll it'll become
intuitive
i i feel like both of them together is
going to be a really steep learning
curve for a lot of people and there's
going to be a lot of
model s drivers using their blinkers
really poorly or making really
bad k turns on roads yeah that's the one
thing okay
so the automatic drive selected oh man
this is this to me is actually probably
a little too far i would have liked to
have seen a
stock for this so here's what's supposed
to happen
and elon basically explained it on stage
but
says that the model s and x refresh
will guess what you're going to do
when you get to stopped and and which
which direction you want to go forward
or reverse
so if you're there are a bunch of
instances where it seems very
straightforward
i back into a parking spot and i park
when i get into that car
i'm going to go forward let's say i go
forward into a parking spot there's a
barrier in front of me i get into that
car
hit the brakes it's just going to go in
reverse for me because it knows i feel
like even with this example you've
already hit a snag
backing into the spot it's going to
guess
yeah so there are there are instances
where it's pretty obvious what you're
going to want to do if i
pull up to a like a if i go to
it's going to say parallel park that's
another one i don't know what's going to
do
but if i just go pull up to something
where there's a wall in front of me and
i'm going to make a three-point turn
i'll pull up to the thing in front of me
it will automatically switch to reverse
i'll back up and then i'll it'll
automatically switch to forward when i
stop backing up
and i'll exit that turn without having
to touch anything and it will have just
done its job for me
that's something we're assuming with
like curbs on it right yeah yeah so can
see when you pull to a stop it's like
now
you've arrived at something in front of
you we're going to switch you to reverse
and it just does it for you
okay so there's a couple well it looks
like it makes sense but then there's a
question of like
i want to parallel park oh yeah i pull
up to a car next to me
i pull up to a stop is it going to know
i want a parallel park will it
automatically reverse for me because it
still sees a street in front of you
yeah it sees like i just pulled up next
to a car like at a stop light why would
i want to reverse i'll keep going
forward so i'm going to have to manually
switch that i'm pretty sure
um there is auto park on these cars but
there's like a whole bunch of other
weird finicky human guessing situations
where i feel like
you're just going to have to do it
manually so i've already assumed
i'm going to be manually overriding this
all the time oh yeah
so my question was how easy is the
manual override and it's this like one
inch wide
slot on the left side of the touchscreen
you swipe forward to go to drive you
swipe backward or down to go to reverse
and you hit the corner to go to park it
seems
okay not as good as a stock no seems
okay
uh a stock is literally just right there
like just popping into drive pop into
reverse everyone knows how to do that
super easy
and i saw someone in a video sort of
demo it like oh yeah it just kind of
feels like a stalk like you just
flip it up to go forward and flip it
down and then he missed and then he
swiped it halfway and it went back and
didn't work and like
he missed the side of the screen like a
whole bunch of questionable
uh misses on the touch screen there so i
cannot imagine
like parallel parking on a busy like
main street is
already like if it's busy enough and you
have to pull up and then the car behind
you can't get past so it has to sit
there and watch your parallel park
i cannot imagine the stress that would
be induced by like
having to hope this thing guesses also
did he use the term guess in the
presentation
i think he did yeah the last thing i
wanted i don't
want to hear i would like no yeah it
will know
like even if yes it's guessing don't say
guess it will decide for you what you
want to do
like i can't wait till i'm on the road
in this two-ton
car guessing what i want to do next
something that did get overlooked a lot
though was uh
right below the wireless chargers there
are four physical buttons
uh haptic buttons okay where you can
switch between drive modes
right next to the hazard button is that
confirmed yes okay
so that seems like it may be a more
reliable or at least i don't know if
you're
it's not going to move any more than the
thing on the touch screen but maybe if
you want like a button more often
that's the other thing i'm kind of
wondering about have we like these
buttons on the steering wheel is there
uh
are they like touch screen ish buttons
or is there like a physical is
enough to where i'm like kind of having
some divider that i can feel between
these
so i was worried about this i was asking
about this in my impressions video they
are haptic buttons they don't click at
all
yeah but is there a differentiator
before i click the button to know that i
am on
new button or something like that like
are they raised a little bit is there
do you know sometimes though when it's
touched they'll put like a a little
raised piece in the middle
so you can tell like oh i'm on the left
blinker or the right blinker yeah okay
good point so they have a little divider
between the left blinker and the right
blinker so you know when you're on which
blinker
but on the other side like the
difference between your horn and your
headlights is just you just have to
press the right
space you just have to hit the right
touch target you just don't know there's
gonna be a lot of model s's honking
and you're not gonna know if you just
messed something up or if someone's just
pressing the wrong button on the
the wheel or people are gonna think
tesla drivers are
angry flashing my headlights was just
like hitting the stock and now it's like
hitting the button on and off real quick
oh yeah you have to go
you gotta hit the one off just just to
flash
not stop being not what i wanted not
what i wanted so yeah we'll see
i would have loved to have seen like an
option for a regular steering wheel
but this is classic tesla they're just
going to go forward with this and
it is what it is kind of the other thing
though it's like we're talking about
getting used to this
not only are you giving people more
power and
more like a more intense driving
potential like now you're giving them a
steering wheel they're much less used to
like
i hope people are safe when they do this
and get used to the steering wheel i
mean for a straight line
yolk's perfectly fine i'm sure people
will launch their cars because
it's clearly a new 0 to 60. but uh
yeah yeah that's going to be fun out of
all of this
maybe the most exciting piece to me is
the new performance so there's there's a
long range version with this new
interior
and there's the plaid motor plaid model
s with the triple motor performance
version with this new interior
um that has a 1.99 second zero to 60
with one foot roll out
so it's probably closer to 2.1 or two
points what does that mean
as a not car nerd good question so a lot
of cars measure their 0 to 60 from
zero and a lot of cars measure their 0
to 60 with a one foot roll out
basically a one foot roll out means
literally exactly how it sounds the tire
starts rolling and once it's rolled out
a foot
that's when they start counting the 0 to
60.
for whatever traction reasons or
whatever there's a bunch of performance
cars that
that measure their 0 to 60 after rollout
and so yeah with this little bit of roll
out you figure the car is already going
like four or five miles an hour by the
time it gets
one foot of roll out over this tire uh
it is still extremely fast
yeah but bragging rights lets them put
1.99 seconds with
a foot of roll out and that's what they
chose to do if you can go
under two you're gonna pick it but yeah
yeah clearly if it needs the one foot
roll out
it's probably not actually an under two
from some do you know like
the average of like what cars like how
many cars use
zero to sixty versus rollout to sixty
typically it's it's funny it's kind of
like whatever they just want like a lot
of performance cars use it with rollout
like if you're asking about the
fastest couple of zero to 60s ever
measured they're all with rollout
and that's fine and we kind of just
accept that um
but this is still fast than all of them
so i guess yeah we'll just we'll just go
with it we'll just go for 1.99 if our
snarky twitter account for a corporate
performance car company i would make fun
of all the other ones that that
one foot roll out yeah enjoy your
handicap
still got to beat it but yeah that's the
other thing is so cloud model s has
a 200 mile an hour top speed with the
right tires anyway
and it's rated at 1020p horsepower which
this is the this is the interesting part
is like it's doing track laps now
without overheating
they've figured out the heat pumps
they've done a much better job
conditioning the battery to keep it
doing launches and doing high
performance runs
over a longer period of time without
overheating that was an
issue with previous model s owners and
model three was already a step forward
with that so that's cool
then they showed this chart on stage
where they showed like p100d
then model s raven and then the
horsepower or i think the torque output
of plaid model s which just kept going
up like it just
it seemed essentially flat at a thousand
horsepower up to 200 miles an hour which
is
kind of scary um but the the main
question is are they gonna
continue to improve on this for roadster
like they have these carbon sleeved
rotors and they have all this crazy tech
to make it work
um i don't know it's just like a next
level
performance gain for a four four-door
sedan with like eight feet of storage in
the back like it's crazy
so i think that's one thing people
always forget is like it's so quick to
like take
model s numbers and compare them to all
these other like
performance cars but then remembering i
mean this is what we made project love
day about
um for people who don't know we did an
old tesla
video contest where we made a video
about like a commercial for tesla we
actually won it
um partially because we have a lot of
fans but the whole video is based on
like
a very fast car being able to do
everyday activities
yeah fun video to make but yeah i feel
like people always forget
about like how much trunk space and how
much like of an everyday car a model s
is
with these numbers yeah so so
390 miles of range is nice
yeah but it's not wait can i say my one
more
my favorite part about plaid yeah go
ahead the logo on the emblem on the back
i love the flat emblem i absolutely love
it
apparently that plaid it was just for
the first 25 deliveries at the event
those people are very lucky because
that's awesome
somebody's probably gonna i bet someone
sells those yeah like i just
love the spaceballs reference um and to
put it physically on the car like that
it's hilarious
i wonder if mine are you on we'll figure
that out later but yeah it says
the the just plaid text on all the
others it's just this plaid pla
is it in plaid nope just uh just like
the other text those just chrome letters
it'll just i don't want one anymore
yeah this is a major detail um
no yeah this is a this is it so so the
the range that people were talking about
this is the
the question that sort of hovered over
this whole event was are they going to
address
plaid plus yeah because what happened
before this event was maybe
just as interesting as the event itself
which is
tesla had also announced and promised
another car
called tesla model s plaid plus
that would have assumedly new battery
technology
520 miles of range a slightly faster
sub 1.99 second zero to 60 and about
1100 horsepower
everyone went well this car is bonkers
why would i get plaid if plaid plus is
coming out next year i'll get plaid plus
then literally hours before the event
maybe a day or two before the delivery
event
it was on sunday and the event was on
thursday
okay so a couple days before the event
uh elon tweets this is like official
tesla news classic but elon tweets that
plaid plus is
cancelled canceled that's the first time
i don't think i've ever seen a tesla
model get announced and then canceled it
was like such a weird way he did
it though because it wasn't just like a
tweet that says plaid plus is cancelled
it was this
thread of tweets where he says
originally modelos goes plaid speed this
week which is like
get everyone amped one minute later
reply thread plot plus is cancelled no
need as plaid is just so good so it was
like a
it's canceled and then let me throw
three percent off with something else
and then a quick like
zero to 60 under two seconds quickest
production car made of any kind
has to be felt to be believed so it's a
very quick like can't wait for a model s
plaid
pie plus is canceled and the plaid is
going to be so good so
just like i actually thought this was
brilliant i mean it's a brilliant way to
announce it when you kind of don't want
but yeah of course test i feel like the
tesla
community was like oh my god this is
awesome did he just say it was cancelled
and then like that was the the news for
like two or three days
yeah and so the question is all right
plaid plus is cancelled number one what
do you mean by
plaid is just as good yeah and number
two why is plaid plus canceled it was
going to have 500 miles of range
and i think there was a follow-up tweet
essentially saying
what elon said yeah so it's actually a
response to
electric i believe and we'll post that
in the show notes as well and he said
uh what we're seeing is that once you
have a range above 400 miles more range
doesn't really matter there are
essentially zero trips above 400 miles
where the driver doesn't need to stop
for restroom
food coffee etc anyway i think that's a
nice distraction
i totally agree with you uh
if you if you really read into that
saying
seems like people don't really need more
than 400 miles
i would argue people don't need faster
than 2.5 seconds 0 to 6
60 even that's a good way to that's a
really good way to put it i didn't think
of it like that so the point is
um we we're using our inferencing and
our context clues to imagine probably
the reason plaid plus is cancelled is
because
the batteries that would have been
needed to create that car
aren't quite available yet they're 4680
cells they're higher density they're
much more impressive technically
and we think they're going to be in
cyber truck and roadster to get those
respective 500 and 600 mile rated ranges
but if we started with plaid plus we're
probably going to be taking
resources and and cells away from those
more important vehicles
so we'll just cancel plaid plus shift
all those orders to plaid
distract them about why we're switching
yo plaid is good enough
it's great trust me it's going to be
just as good basically the same
and just sort of sweep the 200 extra
miles under the rug because that was a
big difference
390 miles 390 miles is nice i currently
have like 300 miles
and 390 as a max range sounds great
but 520 is
way way more confidence inspiring that's
like
literally i could drive to north
carolina from new jersey i can drive
probably to like cleveland from here on
500 miles of range so
i would have been really excited about a
car with that sort of range
uh rather than a 0.2 second faster 0-60
so that to me is a little bit
interesting and concerning but
also brings up questions about uh
well when are we going to see cars with
that type of range are we ever going to
if elon keeps saying if he sticks with
this
uh 400 miles of range isn't really
necessary then
why promise 600 miles for roadster and
500 miles for cybertrek
yeah still happening i think there's a
lot of like weird things to unpack from
that because like
if you're saying you think it's so i
think the approach you're taking for it
is
the optimist i've seen two ways people
are seeing this yours is the optimistic
one like
let's save these for ropes or cyber
truck coming out we don't want
those to be delayed anymore we don't
have enough for them
the other approach is these aren't ready
these cells aren't ready yet
and people don't think they're
completely ready we don't know when
they're gonna be ready
is this gonna mean cyber truck road
circuit delayed further and like
i think both and saying they're not
ready right now means
they're definitely getting delayed so
he's trying to not
put any of the attention on to that
potentially so yeah i wouldn't doubt if
it's like a kind of
little of a little of b like maybe the
batteries are pretty close to being
ready and it would just delay plaid plus
and then if you put
plaid out before plaid plus and i don't
know
there's a lot of speculation going on in
that way yeah but i do think
like i think that's really interesting
what you just said though is like
if you're using the excuse for 400 miles
right now
does that mean you're basically saying
you don't think roadster
or cybertruck should go 500 miles
because like
you could easily make the argument that
a
sports a coupe doesn't need to go 500
miles like who's going on a road trip
efficiency has never been a concern
sports cars so that doesn't make sense
for me now cyber truck on the other hand
like i do think
there are a lot of people looking at
trucks to go long distances
so that makes way less sense but now are
you going to bottleneck
your truck because you used this excuse
previously
yeah or do you actually believe that
which then i think is a whole another
thing where it's
elon looking at numbers way too much
numbers of what he has right now
and then potentially limiting stuff in
the future because of that
so if i just stay with my my just
straight logical brain
number one plaid plus was not cancelled
because plaid was good enough
it was cancelled and the distraction was
plaid plus is good enough trust me yes
it's great
but then two the reason that plaid plus
is cancelled is probably going to turn
into a reason that cyber truck and
roadstar are delayed
yeah probably totally agree with it but
as long as we're not talking about those
yet
we don't have to talk about this yet so
all the focus was on plaid
that night and obviously it's still a
very impressive car 390 miles
is only slightly less than 412 for the
long range so i'm
i'm perfectly fine with that um and yeah
it's a it's an impressive car but yeah
it's just got me
thinking about like how much how much
longer we have to wait for roadster this
was announced in 2017.
was it that long 2017 is when the
roadster was announced
so i mean i knew we would take a while i
think it's i think it's that they keep
like
talking about it or like releasing it
and stuff or showing it
you know at uh the semi-truck event that
gets people more and more hyped for it
and then
you see it pop up every once in a while
but yeah it might take a little longer i
i
what are your thoughts though on wanting
more because
it's one thing to think about 520 miles
as
i would like to go on a 520 mile trip
where in that
singular case i think elon's probably
right chances are on that 520 mile trip
you're going to take
you're not doing it straight you're
taking breaks you're taking restroom
breaks
if there's a charger available at all
those then yeah makes no sense
yeah i think there's tons of other
scenarios though
where that doesn't help in that extra
range um
i think the the one i found the most
interesting is the people who are
the most effective way to charge is
lowest battery correct to around what
60 percent is like the really really
efficient so
now you're zero to sixty percent is much
bigger and a way bigger range
so that means you can now drive further
and still charge as efficiently as
possible
or there are the people who maybe live
in an apartment or in a condo or
something that don't
have a garage and a charging place at
home yeah now they're not charging
every other day they're charging every
three or four days like that's so nice
to not have to i know someone with a
model y
who they live near a college and every
once in a while like every couple days
when they come home they go
drive onto the campus and sit in their
car chargers all the way to full
yeah so they're sitting there for like
45 minutes
that kind of sucks i'll add two more uh
versions of this yeah
i i have basically two types of road
trips that i do
one would be like visiting family and
two would be for an ultimate trip
one for visiting family it'll be here's
the destination
it's this many miles away you're going
to drive there you're going to park
there for a couple days and then you're
gonna drive home
it would be nice to not have to stop at
all
meaning drive there park it for a couple
days and then drive all the way home
and so no if even if it was only a 250
mile road trip if i had 500 miles of
range i would not have to charge and i
would just come all the way home
if it's obviously a much less range i'm
gonna have to charge at some point
the other version is going to ultimate
so literally you're going to go drive
somewhere
park for a couple hours and then drive
home
uh this is for a game not a tournament
but the point is
i just really don't want to have to stop
yeah at all
even if it's 400 300 200 miles i want to
go there
not stop not just go about my day go
about my weekend
and then drive home and the more battery
obviously you have the more likely you
are to be able to do that
there's something also to be said that
like yes there are a lot of
superchargers
but as he says stopping for food coffee
and stuff like that like
that's a valid excuse for stopping
getting to top off but you don't always
get to choose the food that's at these
places so like
we've done a couple of stops one time we
stopped and there's a great burger place
and we all sat down
had a burger and charged a ton because
we were really enjoying the food
then there's like like i'm really hungry
and you stop and it's a gas station with
like a
subway and like or like really
restrooms yeah or some random yeah not
something you want to eat or
you never know like if you want to take
it one step further if you have dietary
restrictions and one of these fast food
places doesn't cater to that very well
cool now you're just sitting in the car
so that's that's when it starts getting
to the point where gas is better i like
your
theory of if you can do 500 miles you're
probably going
further than quite a few gas cars now
you're getting the advantages
over gas cars that's what i was gonna
say yeah so i'll end it with this
before we take a quick break i think if
elon's uh main goal
with cars like this is to give the full
smackdown to gas
powered cars you want to give them every
single reason across the board is better
than a gas car
better 0-60 better technology better
traction better safety better comfort
better torque better everything if you
can also give them better range that's
not a small detail
people will definitely notice being able
to go twice as long
as far as days between filling up
whether it was gas or electric that's
going to matter
so i'd argue it's the biggest hurdle
from gas tv
easy i don't think anyone's doubting
that ev has better
specs and just like potential and just
pure drive train but like
uh what's it called range anxiety is
like easily the biggest thing stopping
people from switch so why are you
limiting yourself
already yeah it seems kind of confusing
to me
so as long as there's less superchargers
and gas stations keep making that range
longer
all right we got to talk about this bmw
i3 yeah so first of all why are we
talking about the i3
well uh i'm currently testing the i3
with range extender
for a column i'm doing for top gear if
you haven't
already seen i've been reviewing a bunch
of evs and high-tech cars
for top gear column i think it's called
hard drive it's a fun one i mean
if you don't watch or read the top gear
magazine check it out
um so the latest uh after the f-150
lightning
will be this and so they get the car
here in our hands for a couple days
and inevitably there's like a first
impression we check out the car a lot of
them are really cool
the i3 with range extender
has been very puzzling to me
in a lot of ways because honestly i'm
trying to think all right what's the
target demographic
like where does this fit into the eevee
landscape we know what the competition
is we know what the price is
i'm just going to give you a couple
quick headliners about this car
yeah and then a question okay this car
cost fifty thousand dollars with ten
thousand dollars of options so it's
60 grand so right off the bat you can
picture other cars that are also right
around 60 grand
then it is a compact form factor so it's
it's a
much smaller than most of the other cars
it's uh
it's got an electric motor and a battery
that can give you
about 175 miles
when full and then it has a three
cylinder engine and a
two gallon gas tank as your range
extender
so you drive around on pure electric
until you run
out and if you ever do run out you can
drive around as a gas car it gets around
35 miles a gallon
for a total of 70 miles on gas
and that's the i3 it's a smaller
so because it is so small
the back seat is very small the trunk is
very small
the front trunk i'm not even
exaggerating i don't think i can fit all
three of these cameras in the front
trunk
no it's just because it has like it's
like it has a couple things inside it
already
because it has an engine it has an
engine yeah and a gas
tank and a battery and the electric
drive fan so it's got all this stuff
in this very small place and so it's
turned into
like uh all right i have 60 grand to
spend on a car
why would i pick this one yeah and i
don't
think i know the answer look do you want
to like take a quick uh
quick roll through like our impressions
when we first got into it it's just like
let's try and let people imagine this
car
a little better i mean if you haven't
seen an i3 um
you know it's a bmw so it's got it's got
the the the grille it's got the little
the nostrils on the front yeah it's a
it's a black and white
two-tone pretty modern looking car a lot
of glass a little split sunroof going on
i don't mind the design
for the size i think the size is weird
but i don't mind the design it's like
weirdly tall so it's kind of looking
like a little minivan
but very mini it has a very like do you
know those hot wheels cars that just
like never really had correct
proportions
so like it's got big wheels it's got big
wheels but the front
is just like so squished but it looks
like it should be bigger but it's
on this small car yeah there's like kind
of this weird
window line where the back window is
like lower than the
front driver side window and or the
front door windows
and it's just like very flat back
hatchback
it didn't have a bad amount of room in
the back for what it was
it's not great yeah um then you get
inside it and it's like
i mean it's bmw so it's going to be nice
quality inside the majority of the
inside minus this one
paneling on the back doors which was
kind of weird it's like
pretty high quality it has some weird
design choices um
this stock is this like gigantic
yeah how do you describe that it's like
a growth out of the steering column
yeah like it would be like holding like
a
a camera lens with like a nub on it to
change like you have to put your entire
hand around it
in order to change gears on it yeah um
it has some nice like blue accents and
everything i like again i don't think
the design is off
it just feels but and then the steering
wheel
feels despite how short the front of the
car is
you feel like you're sitting like in the
middle of the car rather than the front
of the car and like really controlling
it you feel really far
back that was my strength that was my
number one driving takeaway is like oh
there's like really nice visibility and
these windows are really big but there's
a lot of car in front of me and not a
lot of car behind me
i think i'm in the middle of the car
which is like that's an
unusual feeling for a four-door car
technically well not uh
i don't need would you it's four door
yeah they call it when it does so
it has the type of door where you the
back door is like almost a half door
where like you have to open the front
door and then the handle is on the
inside
and you open it similar to trucks that
aren't
like full cab trucks um i don't know if
you call that something a little
different
you can't get in without opening the
first door so i can see i consider it a
four-door because you can't get in the
back seat
but yeah it is a small door i think the
um there's like the
hyundai vlog yellowstar yeah yeah i
think they call that a three-door ticket
well that only had a third door
it has it's sim oh no it didn't have one
on both sides
oh yeah that had that way yeah it's very
good so i i give it four-door status
it's just very compact obviously
yeah um so you have 60 grand yeah
you have it to spend on some sort of new
car
why why would you why would you pick
this one
because it's okay 60 grand for context
new model y
performance performance model y um
that's going to give you
much more range that's going to give you
about 300 ish miles of range that's
going to give you much better
performance this thing isn't a slouch
but it's no performance car right yeah
it's uh smaller wheels it's
it's got a sport mode i would guess it's
gonna give me about a five and a half
seconds zero to sixty
it was like a zippy car when you're
rolling so like merging would be great
in it but
there was literally a time where we went
tried to go from zero to 60
and you like like it was comical
how bad it took to like go like
we all heard you slam your foot down
kind of had a second to look at each
other and then it started
going yeah it was like it's like if
you're in like a crv like when you slam
on the
gas you're not expecting to get rocketed
forward like it's gonna
it'll go oh you want to go faster now
give me a second and then it'll start
moving forward so like
yeah it's nimble and it's zippy it's got
a tight turning radius but like
it's not a performance car so so model y
is going to give you and i'm just using
model y as an example but
much longer range on electric no gas
tank
much much more storage oh yeah much
bigger performance
much more features just as far as
software and autopilot and speaker
system and all this stuff
and so you have to want to get this i3
you've got to
want either something really
compact you've gotta or you've gotta
want a bmw
specifically or you've gotta really
really want for some reason
a plug-in hybrid that has a gas tank
even though it's worth smiling what to
call it it like doesn't really feel like
a plug-in hybrid but it also doesn't
really feel like an eevee i'm like
i'm trying to paint the picture of the
person getting this and i'm imagining
someone who lives in new york city and
has an awful parking spot
sure so they want a compact car yep they
only trust legacy car makers
so they don't trust new things so they
can actually mw
i think you can i think you can stop at
just wants a good compact ev yeah but i
want to get
really narrow with this because i just
there is no other i want to paint the
picture of the person who
loves this who wants obsessed with this
car yeah i'm just there is no other good
compact ev
so i'll give it credit for that specific
achievement but it's still not great
yeah
i mean it would have to be someone with
money to spend because 60 grand is not
cheap for a car by any means um you
would need
like i still think the interior is
pretty solid but nothing like to blow
60 grand on so there's that i mean maybe
if you live in the city having the
compact car
range doesn't matter that much but it
still helps to have that little
kick if you're like uh on one of the the
expressways around new york city and you
need to like zip
over a lane or something like that and
then like
somebody who has is just getting into
the ev world but still has range anxiety
so you have this little reservoir of gas
in there also you don't carry anything
or or
any of your friends are over 5 511 yeah
yeah like
range it's funny if you live in the city
and you can get away with a bigger car
like a model 3 which is not that big but
it's you you almost never have range
anxiety because you have 250 plus miles
of range
and superchargers i feel like you'd have
more range anxiety with a tiny electric
battery and a two gallon gas tank wait
but are there a lot of superchargers in
new york city
enough that you could go around the city
a thousand times with them yeah there's
plenty in the city that cover the actual
radius of the city
and if you have 250 miles of range you
can always get to a supercharger in new
york city
you only have to drive four miles to get
to one pretty much anywhere in the city
so here's a question that's kind of off
the bmw
topic but i saw a video today and i know
is an exaggerated
version of it but there was a
supercharger outside of a
disneyland i believe and somebody was
going to get in line for it and the line
was like
literally like 30 cars deep does that
happen
fairly like i could see that happening
in new york city i've never experienced
that on the east coast
okay i've seen it on the west coast
because there are way more
tesla's specifically on the west coast
yeah yeah that being said
uh i have only waited in line
once for a supercharger and that was on
like a weekend
in the morning where i guess a lot of
people are driving and it was a
new jersey like going south there's like
six chargers and there's dunkin donuts
right there and everyone was just
chilling
probably down to the shore or something
but i i do see some pretty serious
backups
on the west coast where there will be
like 12 chargers and like 12 cars
waiting while everyone else is charging
that sounds like
that nightmare is not great that can
give you that anxiety where you're like
am i going to get to this charger and
it's going to be
full or you know a long wait because if
you don't have enough range to make it
to another charger
you're going to wait potentially waiting
like hours you've got gotta get filled
that's brutal yeah yeah so i no i
haven't experienced that yet
on the on the east coast but yeah new
york city
plenty of chargers plenty of space
plenty of range if you
i'm trying to think like okay what if
you want a compact car
you live in the city you want something
small but you don't care about it being
an ev
you could get any number of compact cars
if you don't care about it being an ev
then this is pointless yeah so you have
to for some reason
want a compact ev
sort of but it has cast but it has gas
but you can get the one you can get the
one that's not a range extender
okay anyway yeah look forward to the
calm on top gear magazine it's just like
a
quirky car i've really yeah it's
obviously this will be very positive i
was just trying to think like
should i make a video about this car at
all it's not really that interesting
other than just the conundrum of like
who would buy this
um and we're asking at the studio like
all right what price would it have to be
to actually want to buy an i3 with 170
miles of range and a 2 gallon gas tank
and we landed at like 25 20.
i don't think 20. i didn't even pay 25
for my car right now and i would take it
over this oh really
yeah yeah i don't i don't think i'd want
this car
no it's neat but i wouldn't choose it if
somebody wanted something like this so
much
so bad it would make more sense for like
smart car to come out with something
like this
and not have a million features like bmw
would and just be
totally on board with this is a compact
car with not a lot of range and a zv
and it'll do the things you need for a
compact car i will say
while i do feel way safer in my car i do
feel safer in this than a smart car
yeah there's a little more of a bubble
around me this thing does feel kind of
like a tank for how small it is
it is it's very uh center of gravity is
very low because of
i guess you know there's batteries in
there and obviously there's a lot of low
weight but
it does feel safer than a smart car so
i'll give it credit for that
yeah i would never say i felt unsafe in
this despite how small it is so i guess
that's kind of one perk
there you go we said something nice
about it good looks good look cy3
i think that's a good place to end it
being positive uh anyway all right well
that's it
