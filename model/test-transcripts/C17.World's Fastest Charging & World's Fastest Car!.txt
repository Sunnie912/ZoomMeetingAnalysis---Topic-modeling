all right welcome back to another
episode of the waveform podcast we're
your hosts i'm marquez and i'm andrew
and today we got a bunch of interesting
quirky things to talk about that have
happened in the past week one of them
would be the fastest charging we've ever
seen
one of them would be the fastest car
we've ever seen and a bunch more stuff
in between
um also you might have noticed we've got
a little bit of a new
intro vibe the new music's feeling
pretty good shout out to vayne still
who's obviously extremely talented he's
made videos he's made
music in mkbhd videos before uh just
leveling up
covering the podcast too the guy is
incredible yeah and a big shout out to
cameron barlow who
made the original music um i think we've
told the story but he was one of the
first people to ever send us music when
we started
wave form and everything we got sent
after that was nowhere close to us good
so we crushed it
og waveform music we're uh taking a new
chapter but big shout out to him because
that was
that was huge two years almost i think
that was going
so now so you've got you've got all you
wrote here is andrew rant about pixel 4
xl
i have no idea what you're ranting about
but yeah the stage is
just gonna like all right we all
first of all let's the elephant out of
the room i'm still using a pixel 4xl
just because you work here doesn't mean
you've got like literally that
i mean marquez does but like we're all
not reviewing the phones as much as
marquez i'm using it
i like it i like the phone it's been
good i didn't love the pixel 5
but but it is out of all the phones i've
had in my entire life it has
caused me the most issues ever like
hands down
out of everything i've ever had okay um
and
right now i'm at the point where i can't
use it unless it's plugged in
and this kind of stems i think all from
possibly the same issue but i'll i'll go
back like a couple months ago to
whatever i was not first had my like
big issue with right not just software
bugs you mean like problematic
i don't believe it's software at all so
the first thing that started happening
was
probably four or five months ago i
noticed
the back glass was like
a little off on the top and i noticed it
because i had a skin on the phone
and i was like oh the skin just looks
way too thick and i realized it was
actually because the glass was starting
to peel off and
at first it didn't seem that bad it just
looked like a little lip and i didn't
think anything of it but
fast forward maybe a month from there
and that lip
now has a gap in it so just the whole
back glass on the phone is like
completely peeling off and that was
because of the battery swap i don't know
what that was because of
i have no reason i don't know exactly
what it was but there was enough of a
gap
that i could see lint had gotten inside
of the phone and inside of the camera
lenses
i can't think of any other reason for
the back glass of the phone to literally
rip out of the glue and come off the
back of the phone i had seen
some things um online of people having
similar issues and
some of their thoughts one was battery
swelling um
another thought was just potentially
heat or something just
making the adhesive like not good enough
to where the adhesive is now just coming
off and not
keeping the glass on the phone anymore
um
because of that my solution to it was to
put a drop of super glue on the top and
then start using a case
i haven't used the case in a while but
i've been a case person
mostly because of that because even with
like the super glue if it if it fixed it
i've pretty much lost
confidently waterproofing the phone
anymore right like there's no reason if
that seal is broken
don't get that anywhere near what yeah
exactly so i i mean
that in itself i've been much more
careful with the phone
so then maybe three months ago my next
problem started where
i was using my phone one day and it was
at 50
and the battery my phone just turned off
as i was using it i thought that was
really strange
um clearly it was at 50 i don't know
what happened
and i plug it in and i get this battery
icon with a question mark on it
and that never ever feels like a good
sign
a battery icon with a question mark yeah
so like the black screen normally when
you plug it in you
get like a red battery icon for your
phone being dead which it shouldn't have
been because it said fifty percent
but i got just a question mark battery
safety shutoff is gonna yeah i guess
i am still not 100 sure what it was but
so my solution that night when it
happened was
okay i'm just going to plug it in and
i'm going to leave it overnight and it's
going to charge i was it was close to
bedtime
and i wasn't quite i didn't feel like
finagling with it for that long
um wake up the next morning and it still
says
i turn it on it says 50 i was like there
is absolutely no way this could be
physically plugged in the entire night
and still be at 50
battery and i don't know what
i eventually did to fix it but it
started working
i eventually got it to the point where
when i turned it off and plugged it in
it had the red battery icon with a
percentage so i knew it was at least
charging which
to me that was a step up because it
hadn't been doing that before fast
forward to the next time it happens
a couple weeks later and i started
researching a bit more what's going
on people are saying that there's
something wrong with the battery
connection itself
and that the battery is fine but the
connection and the reporting to the
phone is what's
messing up so in that process
one of the fixes which i can't believe i
even tried because just reading it
online seemed so dumb
it was turn your phone on which it has
to be plugged in to turn on
turn your phone on turn bluetooth off i
don't know what this part accomplishes
but turn off bluetooth
unplug your phone turn it off and then
you
an inch from the bottom and an inch to
the right you press your thumb as hard
as possible on the back of the phone
and then you plug it in and it starts
charging and it worked
i didn't really question it i kind of
was hoping it was a one-time thing but
then it's
about two weeks after that happened
again i did the trick it worked
i did the trick probably four or five
times until last night finally
same thing phone it's really weird when
it does it too because like
the phone starts stuttering a bunch and
like feels like
you're just like out of storage almost
or like it's it feels like a really old
phone and then just dies
i feel like i understand your problem i
feel like i get it if i had to guess
uh this is it just started with your
battery
like having some sort of problem
swelling up a little bit
so the battery swells up right off the
bat there should probably
theoretically be some safety protocols
in place
when a phone detects that it's battery's
having problems because nobody wants
that bad pr
of like yeah it just swelled up and
exploded in my pocket
so i'm guessing once that happened and
separated your back
the phone realized at some point
battery's not okay
and started limiting what it allows the
battery to do if you realize the
battery's having a problem
don't allow that to charge to 100 don't
allow that to get to zero
don't let that battery discharge too
fast so when your phone starts
stuttering it's probably limiting
the battery so much the voltage of the
parts is also going down
i bet if you replace just the battery of
that phone
everything is back to normal i agree
with
your solution but i don't think that's
exactly what's happening
and the reason i don't think it's
limiting it to like charge 100
or like you're saying you think it's
dying at 50 because it doesn't want it
to go to zero
right yeah i'm saying it's limiting what
the battery is
physically able to do for safety reasons
i think the
battery itself at least in the sense of
it's still getting to 100 because i
charged it to 100 plenty of times when
it wasn't doing that and every time
the couple times when it like uh at 50
died
and i got to fix like within a couple
minutes did the trick
and got it to turn on again yeah the
battery is completely dead so i think
it's losing some sort of connection and
its default is
just set it at fifty percent battery
dead or did it just auto shut off
for safety it it's dead because when i
would plug it in and get it to work it
was at
red battery one percent battery so i
think there's a problem with the
uh the connection and the way it's
reading the battery level
and then probably being safe and
shutting off or
i don't even know it's definitely dying
it's 100 dying because i'm getting one
percent battery
there's no way it's like yeah uh that
would that's what the
solution seems to be google will
apparently
uh rma it but
when you're in a pinch i wanted it to
work and i just kept doing the trick
which is probably the best
bad thing to do and now it keeps doing
that so now i have to figure something
out i would have bailed the second it
started swelling the battery
i still don't know if the battery's
selling but i am 100 today after
recording this
going to open the phone up and see
what's going on and there i'll post
pictures on twitter or something like
that yeah
but i'm kind of excited to see what's in
there well speaking of dangerous
batteries
segway we've got a story and it's really
just a tweet but
xiaomi tweeted um or actually ice
universe tweeted this but it's a xiaomi
video
uh xiaomi released and when we say
release that's in air quotes they've
demonstrated this technical ability
to do 200 watt wireless charging no
wired
sorry 200 watt wired charging and 120
wireless charging
which again those are some crazy numbers
but to put them in context
uh samsung's fast charging right now is
25 watts
okay wait really yes 25 watts um some of
the fastest charging in any phones right
now would be your 65 watt fast charging
and oppo do 120 very bleeding edge
highest end there may be a phone or two
that supports 100 or 120 watt
fast charging which is crazy fast wasn't
uh
the lenovo won that but you had you had
to put two wires
plug in both at once which is insane and
beautiful for a video thumbnail
yeah um this one 200 watt wired charging
is uh i think they demonstrated on a
4600 milliamp hour battery or something
like that
literally they plug it in and i'm i'm
not even exaggerating
within 45 seconds you've gotten 10
percent battery
you can watch the battery percentage go
up in 45 seconds to 10 percent
the whole thing's done in 100 and eight
minutes
zero zero to 108 minutes
now obviously cool all right great
you've demonstrated this crazy ability
to
pump huge voltage through that wire and
through that port and into that battery
what's the catch which is like the
xiaomi is not going to tell you
the catches might catch on fire i think
i honestly think they've probably
mitigated the catching on fire part it's
easy to make jokes about
it's gonna explode and like it's never
gonna work i just think the
the discharge rate is gonna be just as
fast like how long does that battery
last yeah like overall lifetime overall
lifetime and like how many charge cycles
you can have but also
in like daily use i think so do you
think it affects
i think it might affect the overall
discharge time of the battery
in day-to-day use if you can up charge
that fast then you can
output that same speed i don't know this
for a fact i just know that there has to
be a catch
there's got to be it's got to be my
initial thought would be the catch's
battery life not like not day to day but
just overall in general
like yeah health great way but i also
think what's crazy about this is
120 watt wireless charging is now
the fastest we've seen wired charging in
wireless form
yep instead i almost feel like when you
reach down to pick it up you're gonna
like
feel the energy
[Applause]
like a little like force field of just
like power around it like
what happens this phone already gets i'm
holding a oneplus 9 pro for audio
listeners
uh but you should you should check out
the youtube version uh
this phone when it wireless charges it
gets warm yeah and i put it on this
wireless charger and the oneplus
wireless charger has
fans in it so it's blowing those fans
while it's charging quickly to keep the
temperatures down because it knows
that wireless charging just gives off a
lot of heat it's not super efficient
so when you pump that much water what's
the wattage on the one plus
um that's a good question was it
probably 75
a little less than that i think uh 50
watt wireless charger okay
so but it gets warm and like to the
touch this is more than double that
yeah i take the phone off the charger
and i'm like wow this is this is kind of
kind of toasty and i i wonder when you
take that phone off of the 120
wireless charger if you can just like
immediately crack an egg and fry it on
the back of that phone because
that's something that's something else
wasn't it uh it was like the htc ultra
that
mirror finish one where the press kit
came with a white glove because of how
many fingerprints
i feel like this charger is going to
come with a glove just or uh
what are those fireplace tongs that you
put the like the log in with
yeah yeah this will be interesting
xiaomi does this a lot and we don't
necessarily get to see it
happen in a phone like we might not have
200 watt wired charging in a phone this
year
but it's cool that they're pushing that
limit my question is
are we going to get to a point where it
doesn't matter how fast it charges
anymore
if every phone charges at 150 watts are
we are we good
do we do we stop never you keep going
300 watts
400 watts when is it going what point do
you just like tap it on something and
you just have full battery again
it's it's that weird i think the better
version
of this future of battery check is long
range wireless charging so that you're
almost
always at 80 everywhere you go
i think that's like in room wireless
charging would be really
cool yeah because then you don't have to
worry about my phone battery is low let
me go to a charger i think this plugging
in
in a wire will eventually be an
old version of what we think of what
charging used to be
and now or not now in the future we
won't really think about charging ever
because we'll always be somewhere near
this wireless charging happening
now again the what's the catch question
always comes up with that like is that
safe if it's always radiating to our
bodies is it going to be a problem
will my phone get warm in my pocket as
it's charging i don't i don't know all
the answers here
but i imagine with all the downsides of
both of these versions i would rather
have
my phone always at eighty percent rather
than going from zero to 102 seconds it
just seems crazy
i mean i would also just like a a better
built battery where i can fit
10 000 milliamp hours in the size of a
phone that is right now
i feel like at some point we're going to
stop improving the charging tech and the
batteries just
have to improve as well but do you have
a
um a lowest speed you'll go or a highest
speed like
i don't really have goals for batteries
anymore like i feel like they're good
we work in a situation where battery
charge is like
almost never an issue like i rarely find
situations where
batteries that big of a deal i guess
like if i were going camping or
something or hiking and or a long day
out or
ultimate tournament which i don't do
anymore but
that's when it i would ever really push
it but at this point
i don't know yeah i never really get
towards the end unless it says 50
and it's not really and then just does
so yeah i just i'm imagining
xiaomi going oh we did it again now we
have 300 wireless wired charging and it
goes zero to
a hundred percent in six minutes flat
great it sounds like it sounds like it's
more of a headline
for a while until uh then it won't be
kind of like uh
why can't i remember dxomark oh dxomark
great headline dixon it doesn't really
matter anymore
batteries start doing battery charging
ratings
until you get over that actually sounds
way more interesting than what they're
actually doing
why i would just like to see if they
could scientifically just
test how it's affecting battery health
and how fast it's actually charging and
then how it's charging at different
percentages and stuff like that and give
it a an overall score it's a much
less subjective rating system also
because like
the biggest complaint with dxomark is
that it's like pretty subjective to what
they think is a good photo and right
it's scientifically driven based on
their subjective viewpoint
so battery can't really be yeah either
last sword doesn't
yeah i think this video literally i mean
you can you can
plot out on a chart the zero
to 100 percent battery which is like
it goes real fast at the beginning like
i said 10
in 45 seconds and then evens out and
you're done in eight minutes
and i just i can't imagine much faster
than that being particularly useful but
great i'm glad xiaomi's getting there
maybe put it in a phone
uh speaking of zero to 100 real quick
i'm on a roll um rimac concept 2
which has now been renamed to the rimac
nevera
the vera so the concept ii uh started
making a little bit of press runs
they've been they've been working on
this car for a long time
for those unfamiliar the rimac concept 2
or the rimac navera we we did a video on
the concept one which is a million and a
half dollar
tiny supercar you know mega hyper car
that's
fully electric very tiny very electric
very fast they are made they only made
like eight of them they're making a
larger run of these but they're gonna be
1900 horsepower massive power
four motors one at each wheel and these
are going to be hyper cars
and uh they've been calling it the
concept too and they're starting to like
get to finishing development on it and
they've been saying like oh we're at 85
power we're at 90 power we're almost
done
um i saw a car wow video where they now
have done
a drag race with the
the navera and the ferrari sf90
and again i just want to give context
because the sf 90 it's not a million
dollar hyper car but that's
just about as fast as a as a car gets
today
um we are looking at the fastest ever
production
quarter mile times of like any street
car ever made
and i think it's like top three of all
time it gets 0 to 60 in like 2.3 seconds
it gets to the quarter mile in well
under 10 seconds
uh it beats the mclaren 765 lt off the
line it's like a half million
car it's incredible um this car makes it
look like a toy
it literally blows past it and the
the crazy part is like the sf90 is a
hybrid it's got this great launch and
then it combines the electric motors
with gas power
this this navera did not have a problem
with it so if you watch that video
it does 0 to 60 in 1.85
seconds oh my god i mean we're getting
to the point where
production cars now have to be we have
to look at the hundredth of a second
to like kind of really differentiate now
because roadster is claiming 1.9 right
so 1.85 it clearly wants the headline
over roadster which also
how long until roadster gets a software
update and they're trying
to beat that the thing about that time
is
you are basically approaching the limits
of traction with
rubber tires so when you say 1.9 versus
1.85 it's like
on a perfect prepped surface with the
exact right battery and the perfect
launch
that's as fast as you can go with motors
wait quick question
with electric is there such thing as
like a non-perfect launch
yeah and you just don't have good
traction like a bad circumstance okay
you're saying
pure grip not actually like people go to
a prepped drag strip with sticky tires
and a sticky
like launch environment and they can
maximize traction
almost artificially because the streets
aren't like that and they will get
1.9 seconds but on the street it's never
going to be that fast you're always
hunting for traction on street surfaces
the point is
um it's not going to get much faster
than this
with with uh with just tires so i think
roadster is using some tricks
well what's funny about that is and what
i think is funny about one of the things
i read about this
is because of how fast that is and
because of how powerful that is
there they have this like driving ai and
like a built-in
driving coach that inside the car
teaches you how to properly handle the
car because it assumes people just
straight up cannot handle that and it's
a it's coming at 2.4 million dollars and
only 150 made
so so it's like don't mess it up you
need to teach someone how to drive this
you know when gender did that uh
fighter pilot like ride-along they had
like a two-seater basically remember
they had like a two-seater uh jet that
you get to ride along and you have to
learn to like contract your leg muscles
to keep the blood above your heart and
like
breathe a certain way to stay not
blacking out
like if you need to give lessons to
people you probably shouldn't be selling
it
i mean there's only 150 of these but
like we kind of had this conversation
like let's assume
we get to the technology where tires can
handle it and these can go faster
at what point does the human driving it
become the limiter of how fast i know i
know there's got to be an actual answer
to this right there's got to be some
physicists out there that can it would
just be how many g's you can handle
right like how before you just pass out
they were saying uh the zero to 16 1.1
with the spacex roadster with the with
the like
cool rocket thrusters on the back is
like two and a half g's
and it's fine because it's two and a
half lateral g's
so if you just get kicked in the back
and you just
just get shoved forward at two and a
half g's you'll you won't black out but
you'll really feel it
but humans don't really go too far past
two and a half g's like on a regular
basis
ever at what point does the 0-60 still
count if it
self-drives the passed out human in the
driver's seat past
60 gets the time and then someone has to
like give cpr to
if you win the race you win the race i
bet that would still hit a headline
okay i think we i think we covered
everything yeah
i mean i'll just i'll toss in there uh
top speed 258 miles an hour
20 kilowatt hour battery pack is that
right that's what i pulled from the
article
that doesn't seem right also it just
looks
really nice wait 200 kilowatt hour
battery pack or
did i just i hope it's 200 because 20
would
you'd empty that in one drag race 120
kilowatt hour battery pack okay oh i
missed the one
that'll that'll do it 120 i mean the the
current top of the range stuff
that that number still means not much to
me because i haven't
experienced living with an electric car
so that
that's just total size of battery pack i
just don't know what is a
uh yeah i mean so the the older teslas
that were 75 d
were a 75 kilowatt hour battery pack
then they had the 80d
the 85 plus that was always the number
of the kilowatt hours so then they had
p100d whereas i do understand that i
just always
okay yeah 100 is like the standard right
now but the future stuff will be over
that i
have i can't get a concept of how big
this car is it does look bigger than the
other one but
the other one was like under your waist
tiny and then lengthwise this looks like
much longer and much more
similar to i mean maybe what we assume
roadster is going to be like
it looks really good too yeah from the
one time i saw roadster
in person it's not a small car i mean
it's a low car
but it is like aventador big like it's
still
got some length to it uh this to me
looks somewhere in between or what about
like
original roadster original roadster is
tinier it's much smaller okay
yeah so it's it's gonna be a it's gonna
be a like
huracan plus this one for context yeah i
think so
but either way i'll probably never drive
it i mean if if if
rimac wants to get one out here to the
studio didn't he like
tweet at you or something he did want us
to get our hands on one
and i would happily do a whole autofocus
video with it living with it
there's only 150 customers that can even
care about something like this but i
would have to i would assume at best
at best he'd give it to you on like a
track or something i would do that
but yeah that sounds awesome that sounds
fun sick all right speaking of electric
things moving fast
tesla is constantly changing their cars
constantly changing their cars this is
something we've talked about in tesla
videos in the past i made a video about
how
you can look at it multiple ways but
tesla doesn't have
model year numbers it's so traditional
to just have a 2020
2021 2022 and every single car you get
from that model year
is based on the same thing plus options
yeah tesla doesn't do that
they will refresh the tech when it's
ready and they are constantly rolling
out
micro adjustments to software and
hardware tweaking things
adding ventilated seats changing the
head rests lumbar support
random things will just change in the
car and you just kind of get the car
based on when you bought it um
and it seems like the way people
generally find out about a lot of these
small ones is
through forms like reddit or twitter or
something like that where they're like
no there's like in there okay there's
three ways i would say that people find
out about the changes to the cars
one is and none of them are through
tesla yeah like
sharing it themselves uh one will be
elon will
respond to a customer about something on
twitter
like hey my car has this harness did you
what is this new
and it'll go yeah all the cars produced
after november 2020 have this new thing
uh two will just be yeah like a
subreddit post or somebody spying a car
somewhere that has a new feature on it
or there's a lot of people who take
delivery
realize something's different and then
it's people confirming that with their
new deliveries and then they use the vin
number
to to kind of when it works if yeah if
your car will have it based on
exactly so you know once in a while the
configurator changes and you see a
substantial difference but a lot of
times this stuff is just kind of quietly
happening
so the latest one is like it was a just
the right combination of changes to make
a nice headline where tesla's prices
went up a little bit
and then they removed like one or two
features which is awesome price
fluctuations something we're used to as
well
with them all the time hitting two of
those like you said
perfect storm price goes up something
gets removed
big old headlights yeah uh this one was
a little more
interesting uh that they're getting rid
of radar
in their cars and i thought this was
more than just like a micro adjustment
this is actually sort of
future looking as far as their reading
the headline as someone who doesn't know
is specifically what radar does or own a
tesla
it feels like a huge huge headline it's
really interesting getting rid of radar
um
yeah i didn't know much about it so i
quickly just like googled it and
the tesla subreddit is pretty pretty
awesome just like a bunch of people
owners going back and forth about it i
usually like to read that before i read
some articles and
top comment was uh let's see it's
because their current radar is beyond
useless for
anything other than acc which i also
don't know what that means
active cruise control okay um it says
radars from 2010
has major issues distinguishing stopped
objects has a very
only forward and low field of view low
resolution and
low resolution and range and can can't
classify objects
and then it also in the like rain and
snow
has a hard time yeah okay i have some
thoughts on this
okay um and they're a little bit mixed
because i understand the vision
that's a pun um tesla is moving mostly
entirely in the future towards a hundred
percent
vision-based autopilot which means they
will only use the
cameras on the car for sensing what's
around the car and steering and driving
reading signs seeing cars recognizing
objects on the road all that will happen
through the cars
cameras on the front cameras on the side
cameras on the back um
and this is something that's been like a
sticking point in like different
uh company's strategies for autopilot so
waymo for example will use
high-resolution
maps and sensors on the car we did that
ride in las vegas
where we rode around in a taxi that was
entirely
you know driverless yeah nx and that was
using
high resolution maps and it was a cool
demo but if you ask
elon about it he would say that's useful
in that one high resolution mapped area
but it's not broadly applicable for the
entire globe
you can't high resolution map the whole
world
if you just want to go down a trail
somewhere just have your car drive you
to the grocery store it has to work
everywhere
so their tesla strategy has always been
we're going to use
all the sensors on the car and just look
at what's around
and and map our way through whatever
situation we're in and the car will be
smart enough to understand it
now going vision only and removing radar
seems smart because it should be able to
use visual cues to identify everything
and like they mentioned radar can't
identify stop signs radar can't really
tell what's a car and what's a truck
that's all happening from the cameras
but i found radar to be a useful extra
sensor
for a couple small things one is that
low
field of view has notoriously bounced
underneath the car in front of me to see
the car
in front of the car in front of me and
show that car
on the map so if that car breaks my car
already knows before the car in front of
me breaks
it's gonna start to get ready to break
just in case like
it's got a better vision in inclement
weather
this is something uh i guess it's a
little controversial but like
cameras can get frosted you know ice
over them cameras can have a hard time
in the snow
and radar doesn't have nearly as much of
a problem with rain and snow
um it's still you know very rudimentary
and low resolution at seeing the car in
front of you in the car next to you but
at least it's seeing something
where a camera might miss it so i always
felt like radar assisted vision was
pretty much the right move it's a good
combo
but now tesla's shipping model 3s and
model-wise with
no radar sensors at all just the cameras
and because they're making this switch
all of these new cars people are getting
have slightly reduced autopilot
functionality just for safety they're
you know only going up to a certain
speed and they're obviously not working
as well as the cars with radar and
they're planning on with software over
time catching back up to the cars with
radar
it's just a tech thing that tesla does
sometimes where they make a change and
some of the cars are different from the
ones on the road
um but i find it interesting i'm curious
if it's going to catch up to
radar assisted vision because i always
felt like radar assisted vision was
great
um there's a couple i read the whole
reddit thread
of like owners talking about this and
there's a couple things people were
thinking one is
kind of like what you're saying they you
know despite maybe it being
an outdated specific radar that they're
using they did appreciate the redundancy
and something that yeah you know
it's ultimately driving your car and
could be your life if
if uh it comes to that so like we like
redundancy
in that for sure there are also a lot of
people who
think and i forget exactly why but
there's some people who think that
they're going to eventually upgrade the
type of radar system that they're using
and in the future could potentially be
another radar system
just getting rid of the one they
currently have now but did elon make
like an
announcement that they're switching to
only that or is that just an assumption
because of the
lack of this radar no they they've made
it clear that they
they want to go vision only okay yeah
then that seems
so it's unfounded yeah yeah i don't know
i i'm curious if it's actually gonna
work basically
uh i've learned not to bet against the
eventual
inevitable future of what they're
working on but
uh i i didn't see any good reason
why that redundancy isn't a good thing
it's like to you can bet against or not
bet against the eventual future but that
doesn't mean there won't be
hiccups and some bumps along the way in
that process
i think that's like the best way of
describing tesla like they've made it to
where they want to
there are certainly a couple hiccups
along the way though yeah
i could see that with this the road to
the future was never smoothly paved
now you don't even have radar to tell if
it's smoothly painful
um one other thing you kind of mentioned
it briefly but another
kind of headline which i thought was
kind of ridiculous was
it looks like people are finding out
their new model wise do not have lumbar
support in the passenger side
and for anyone who is upset with this
headline
my first question i want to ask you is
have you ever gotten into somebody's car
in the passenger seat and adjusted the
lumbar support because i
have never ever done that that's a good
point i don't think i've ever adjusted
the lumbar support as a passenger in a
car but also is it losing
adjustable lumbar support or is it just
losing losing adjustable lumbar support
i guess i don't know if
i honestly don't think most people can
tell if he has lumbar support or not
maybe i'm being naive i think i've never
changed it in my driver's seat
i think we're being ageist ages i think
we're being too young here
as a i've got a pretty awful back as a
as a person who has
started to have occasional back
things i i feel like i care about the
lumbar support but i'm the driver so i
don't really
mess with it too much when i'm not the
driver but uh i guess
does every seat had necessary like every
seat has some sort of lumbar support
right like i guess tesla's not exactly
known for the like
high quality of their seats there was
that whole like chevy
these are chevy spark seats blah blah
blah i'm assuming it's not that anymore
but
i guess losing it i don't know i've had
four knee surgeries my back
is terrible like for being 30 my back is
way worse than have you ridden on the
passenger side of my car yeah
it's fine i have no issues with it i
mean maybe on a long trip i would be
less comfortable than maybe some other
seats but like
nothing about it we drove to boston that
one day and oh yeah i was totally fine i
was passenger seat the whole ride
all right i certainly didn't adjust it i
can tell you that
from what i hear model 3 and model y's
seats are much better than model s
much better than my seats so if it's
even better
i'm not complaining too much i get that
it's a removed feature and it's a nice
headline but
i understand that people don't like
seeing this is more expensive and has
less things
but i don't feel like lumbar supports
the hilda dion for that
all right here's a question do you think
so we know tesla doesn't do yearly
updates with their cars do you think
this new crop of
electric cars and new companies coming
out will follow in the same footsteps
and also not do model years
is that the future of cars no more model
years or will they all eventually fall
into a 20 21
22 thing so my thought on that
kind of if i can talk about f-150 for
like i know we've talked about it a lot
but i think it kind of has to do with
the market they're targeting right now
ford's
when we talked to the guy from ford who
brought the f-150 who is
absolutely fascinating by the way just
hearing all the stuff they went through
being a like
a legacy car manufacturer who's now
diving into the ev world
their huge goal and like a big reason
they did that thousand pound
epa mileage was like they don't want
anyone coming to ev and being
disappointed with it
so i think if you are affording the
f-150 you have to do yearly updates
because that's what people are used to
and people who are buying cars in that
market pickups
specifically are used to that if you're
rivian
who clearly doesn't have a market
already
i think you can go the tesla route and
do that ultimately
maybe this is just because we're used to
it i would like to see some sort of a
yearly update just because it's easier
to keep track of things and keep track
of
features and additions and subtractions
yeah i don't think it needs it i think
it's fine everyone with tesla has
made do it almost turns into a game with
this whole like my vin number doesn't
have lumbar support
like i think it's kind of funny maybe
not as the owner of the car but
as an outsider it's kind of funny as
someone who has bitten in the past
i'm like please make it more predictable
i think it would
be interesting i was going to say it's
interesting point i was thinking
it's just going to be about the company
making it if it's an old company they're
going to be stuck in tradition and
they're just going to keep doing model
years like ford
but if it's a new company then they
don't care at all about that but i do
think
if you are a
even a rivian for for that matter or
porsche
you want to make things simple and easy
to understand
you do want to make some sort of yearly
or like well understood updates so
people can know exactly what they're
buying at any given time
and tesla seems to be the only company
that's actually gotten away from that
successfully ever so like them getting
there are a lot of traditions in
car manufacturing and car selling that i
despise
yearly updates is not one of them i i
think it's
it's just easier marketing it's easier
for people to understand i mean even
just the used car market can get kind of
confusing when you like
you maybe you see the new rav4 and
you're like oh i want to go get a used
one
this is listed as a 2012 and you see
it's a totally different
model like it's much easier to keep
track with that yeah um
there are what i love that tesla does
differently is like dealerships i wish
we would get rid of those but
yearly updates i think is you're not
losing much
by uh continuing to do them yeah i guess
cars are such a large complex thing like
even in
tech like you have yearly updates for
everything like you have the 2021 ipad
and you have
the galaxy s 21 and the s22 will be next
year and you just you have like these
yearly updates so
when you want to go back and and analyze
the old ones or maybe buy a used one you
can go
let me see the model year from yes this
is the year they did that with the
screen
like you always know by the model year
so i hear people talk about older cars
like oh
if you're getting an f-150 like avoid
the 2007 to the 2013 they did this weird
thing with the engine like
they just know that that's what happened
but if you're trying to do that with
tesla or if
you ever look at trying to buy a used
tesla it is
kind of a mystery other than the basic
specs what you're going to get will you
get ventilated seats
i don't know we're still pretty new into
the like used tesla market right i mean
i know they've been around for like
10 years at this point but still it's
pretty common to buy a 10 year old car
and use
because especially if it's a lease or
like a rental that's then getting sold
used
they're usually perfectly fine if they
have 50 000 miles on it
yeah so tesla it's really cool because
in theory
batteries last longer than typical gas
engines so then you should be able to
sell teslas
on the used marketplace for longer and
longer and they should hold more and
more value
but if you it's so much harder to market
that used car because
because it's a piece of tech yeah yeah
it's a piece of tech and
because it doesn't have yearly updates
yours you could say a
2015 tesla model s
but if they made a change somewhere in
2015 that could be too completely
different which they did they made a
huge change in 2016.
i didn't mean to hit uh it's striking
yeah will you have autopilot or not i
think so
maybe i don't know yeah no that'll be
it'll be interesting to follow i
i kind of feel like yeah tesla gets away
with being the exception to the rule for
so many things but i also do like that
they break
and and really don't adhere to so many
of those traditions of
the older car industry i don't mind not
having dealerships totally fine with me
please please please please everyone
don't they have to though
to sell cars in texas people have to go
like outside of texas to buy the cars
because of
like some dealership law i don't want to
get too deep into it but that's another
ancient piece of legislation that has
been applied to dealerships and
happens to be awful for tesla but
hey yeah that's just that's just the way
it is in 2021
all right speaking of not knowing what
you're going to get from tesla
we've got a headline from electric you
like that segway right yeah you've been
pretty on today i've been on my money
destroyed mine last week but this is
good
i'll let you i'll let you have these
this is good so uh
there's a it's really just a trademark
filing is all we have but the concept is
really interesting so
apparently back in 2018 elon musk said
that tesla plans to open
quote old-school drive-in roller skates
and rock restaurants
at one of the new tesla superchargers
near la
um this is kind of like a really is he
joking or is that like actually like a
plan that he has to do
and then tesla actually did file for the
trademark for
i guess a sort of burger joint type
thing where
they could eventually oh tesla trademark
registration is intended to cover the
categories of restaurant services pop-up
restaurant services
self-service restaurant services and
take out restaurant services
so now the natural idea is well every
time you're supercharging you probably
want to grab some food that's like
probably the number one activity people
do
when charging for a while i would say
that's the best way to sell
supercharging to somebody who's
so like when we travel when we travel
pretty far in your car
though the one main thing is you have to
stop the charge at some point and most
people don't like
the biggest argument between gas is gas
takes two minutes to fill up
charging can take like 20 minutes to not
fill up but you know get you
far enough to where you go every time we
would stop we would plan it specifically
to eat in that time
and by the time we would eat it would be
plenty of time to do that so it doesn't
even really feel like you're
charging or making that stop so if you
add
a restaurant or food to all of this it
makes perfect sense because then
as long as you keep your road trip
planned out accordingly and there's good
food there
it almost won't feel like you're
refueling yeah it feels like
it also feels like a smart business
decision if you're tesla
right now you're you're investing all
this money in building superchargers
right
so naturally you're trying to be smart
about where you put the superchargers
people are going to want to stop at rest
stops
malls uh like obviously
restaurants and things like that where
it's easy to take a break and have a
bite to eat
so business 101 is why not
make money from that too like if you can
open it if you can build your own rest
stop
and have tesla superchargers and a tesla
merch shop and
burgers and like a whole bunch of the
most common activities for 20 minutes
while charging
that's a good investment because you
make your money back from it
um so i could see that being like a
casual thing they start to do an
experiment with
i think they just follow the trademark
just to be safe like that's just the
thing companies do
but i don't know if they have plans for
like people rollerblading out of you
know
a door with a burger on a platter or
whatever but
it's kind of just kind of a fun idea i
think it makes sense so like
business-wise that just makes sense
you weirdly hit a weird gripe i have
with not anything tesla related but
about
road tripping it makes me furious when
i'm on
like going for a long trip and we're
trying to find somewhere to eat and in
google maps we
type in restaurants or type in a place
we want to stop at
click it and it brings me to a mall
it makes me so angry like i've been
driving four hours all i want to do is
grab something to eat and now you took
me 10 minutes out of my way to be at a
mall where i either have to park the car
walk all the way inside the mall sit
down and get something to eat or i guess
get it to go
but like just differentiate that
which makes perfect sense for this now
though because if a tesla supercharger
is at a mall and now out in that back
parking lot where the charger is
has something you can grab to eat makes
way more sense although
with 20 minutes you probably could run
into the mall but
google maps please i just want that one
feature so bad just this is
bringing me to a mall there's a thing in
um in tesla superchargers too so i was
driving up to practice
which is above new york near connecticut
and
i was a little bit early so i was like
oh let me just you know stop at one of
the nearby superchargers and charge
up for a little bit just because i have
time and so i just picked the one on the
map that was
closest to it and drove to it and it was
like
in the bottom of a parking garage that
was like underneath the but it was like
just
tucked away like hard to find and
annoying and i wish there was some sort
of indicator on the map
of like this one's in a parking lot this
one is in a paid parking garage
in a mall like those are that should be
different on the map because i really
don't feel like
doing that although some of them uh some
of the parking garages if you are only
there for 20 minutes they don't charge
you
luckily which is good but yeah that was
uh
that was kind of fun to see but yeah no
i i think that uh
that like restaurant and just take just
the the overall
like vertical integration of like okay
tesla owns the property
tesla owns the chargers tesla will
probably have solar panels because they
want to do a
renewable energy at all the chargers
tesla will make that energy tesla will
sell you food while you're there and
probably merch and probably other stuff
too
and they just own the entire pipeline
that's what a good
multi-billion dollar company probably
looks like in the future
as far as like autonomy and charging on
the go and one of those things
specifically stood out where it says
self-service restaurant so like
it even doesn't need to be a full-blown
diner restaurant
kind of burger joint or even something
like that if it's just like a pretty
easy
like similar to like those new amazon
shops
out west where it's like you walk in and
there's not even someone working there
you're just like
or there's people restocking but you
grab it and it it tells what you took
and then as you walk out it charges you
for it there's not even a cash here
so it's good yet i mean no but we're
talking about the future here like this
is just a trademark we've got a while to
go
true because i was thinking about being
out of the question i was like what is a
self-serve restaurant i can't think of
like what that is but i guess
you know the whole foods of the future
where you just walk in
grab the thing and walk out and it
charges you
is the idea yeah i mean i would probably
prefer it to be
people there cooking and it's like
fresher food but it could also just be
something simpler wraps sandwiches
pre-made stuff
you stock it up in the morning because
like you also have to think about this
makes great sense but you have to
have a high enough profit margin for the
people who are not working there all the
time
and what are the hours going to be is it
going to be 24
24 7 there's a lot of questions and
we're still just at the trademark but
yeah i think it could be really cool
yeah wild speculation on a trademark is
my favorite oh yeah that's what this
podcast is all about
yeah speaking of wild speculation oh man
i'm crushing
i'm crushing is this a speculation
segways yeah because this is a rumor
okay okay speaking of speaking of wild
speculation
uh we've got a huawei p50
rumor slash image slash leak
from ice universe i just like i just
opened it and the top comment is huge
just saying
lol in all caps it is a
it is an image i'm just going to paint a
visual picture for you so imagine
the back of the phone right on the back
of the phone
somewhere in the top left you have your
camera bump
now i want you to look at the back of
your phone and divide it into quadrants
i have a really good way to describe
this i feel like
i'm just going gonna say if you can
picture the the back of your phone into
quadrants top left top right
bottom left bottom right picture the
entire top left
binoculars two huge circles looking at
you
this looks almost looks like to me um do
you know how john rettinger does those
thumbnails where he's
focusing on cameras on smartphones where
it's the smartphone back and he
he dislocates basically the camera bump
and zooms it up
this looks like uh maybe like the iphone
10s
which had the vertical two camera and
then
john renders zooming it out and just
slapping it back on the back of the
phone
but it's weird because it's it's got
three cameras inside the top
circle yes and then another camera and a
flash inside the bottom
circle i assume the bottom one is like a
large like
periscope lens or some sort of large mod
like that sharp
phone that's probably that's rumored
yeah you know that one with this just
like one
giant camera yeah so the fact that it's
in a larger circle is
purely aesthetic and they're just
leaning into this circular aesthetic and
so
it just looks like binoculars on the
back i think the best way to describe it
is imagine a vertical
camera system that's gigantic and then
there's
cameras that's just the bump the cameras
are inside
what you thought were the cameras
because when i first saw this from the
corner of my eye on your screen
i thought i just had two gigantic
cameras on the back that would be
and i don't know if that would be better
or worse i don't think the phone is
going to be bad i don't think a phone is
thick enough for cameras to be that
actually huge
i think this is just an aesthetic yeah
yeah it's just a look
it's a look it's a look man this is
actually the way the p50 looks be
prepared for the memes because you know
some companies do things for the memes
it looks like wally that's another good
one oh if you just scroll down the
comments yeah the comments are great
there's more stovetop ones like
i highly recommend you scroll down and
look at the memes we'll
same energy so turntables
oh my god this is great sonic microwaves
it's good i don't know it's dead mouse
ears interesting i haven't said mouse
years that would be
i feel like you could skin some cool
things on this and use
use that as inspiration on on top of it
but like
yeah it's just a weird look i don't know
it also has a flash in between them
it's great it's so i don't really get it
i mean the the focus of the thing is the
focus of so many of
these new smartphones coming out is just
the the cameras and the differentiation
of the cameras and we already know
xiaomi huawei they're not afraid of a
big camera bump
like they're not afraid of going
absolutely nuts with how crazy the
cameras look on the back of the phone
whether or not their cameras are
actually the best in the business
debatable but they're not afraid to have
a creative camera ball i still think
if you're going crazy camera bump you go
horizontal and you go
as high up as possible so when it leans
on the phone it's almost like a wedge
like
i kind of imagine the pixel six rumors
which you know has that big like
daft punk looking horizontal if that
continued up to the top or was closer to
the top edge i think that would be like
perfect
but this is just kind of crazy wobble
yeah and it's gonna wobble a lot yeah
speaking of wobble no just kidding i'm
fresh out i'm fresh
out of segways but i'm fresh out of
topics
we've talked about a lot of stuff so far
but
honestly uh i think it was worth it you
actually wound up segueing the end of
the
yeah fresh out of segways like fresh air
topics i think that was the best one of
the episode
let's go i crushed today's segways
a plus feel free to let me know how i
did in the comments but i'm pretty sure
i crashed
um anyway that's about it for uh this
week
we'll be back shortly of course we've
got a lot more to talk about
and wwdc is next week speaking of wwdc
we're gonna have a discord stage event
next week
that's the plan we're gonna have uh
right now wwdc is going to happen and
then we're going to talk about wwdc
probably live with you guys on discord
and in video form so stay tuned for all
that
and more of course it'll probably be a
lot of announcements on stage i'm
excited i'm sure
next week is going to be a lot to talk
about hype yeah either way
see you guys then thanks for watching
catch you guys later
