what's up guys welcome back
to the waveform podcast we're your hosts
i'm marquez and i'm andrew
and uh what are we talking about this
week with wwdc this week i mean
it's hard not to talk about it um
there's obviously
a whole lot to talk about so before we
take a craig dive into that wwdc hole
we're just gonna check out a couple
quick stories we have beforehand
do you like that i thought of that right
before craig died if i swear he does it
for the memes
it was too good um okay the the first
thing we have here
i i wrote this down because i wanted to
just just present
some numbers just to to hear it just so
you guys can hear the numbers uh
there's four iphone
games that each gross more than a
million dollars
per day yeah and i just want you to
think about that just like okay
there's a lot of there's obviously a lot
of people that use the iphone there's a
lot of people that play games on the
iphone
and there's a lot of micro transactions
and ways for those developers to make
money from those apps but
the top couple uh i think i'm gonna
i think we wrote this down real quick
here uh the number one
roblox makes an estimated
3.01 million dollars
per day that's in red
i know how popular roblox is i feel like
it's similar to
minecraft fortnite levels of hype and
it just really is proving that this
whole like
microtransaction free-to-play platform
is a money maker oh yeah i just what do
people buy in roblox i don't like
skins i mean wow that's what i think
i don't know it wouldn't surprise me i
don't think it's a game that has a whole
lot of competitive
modes to it so i don't think there's
much you can get in the game that would
actually give you a competitive
advantage over anything
um usually microtransactions in
pc xbox stuff games don't give you any
competitive advantage you just get like
aesthetics yeah but mobile games are one
of those games where you can get it
like if you think of um i don't know if
you ever play like clash of clans or
boom beach there
there are a lot of these games we're in
beach it's called boom beach yeah
it was pretty much like you develop a
like island base and you go around and
attack other
island bases game
similar but like the thing about it is
is imagine in a tower defense game if
you
built one of your towers and then you
have to wait
24 hours before you can build anything
else until that tower is complete
but if you're willing to spend tokens or
whatever spend money on tokens you can
make that
you can build it in a second and then
get better at the game by paying
more money so it's generally a lot of
these games are time based i think
claire was even playing like the sims
and in the sims you can like
do an action or build something in the
house and then you have to wait x
amount of time and you can pay to do it
faster
so there are actually these like
competitive advantages
in a lot of these mobile games which is
probably why they're
making so much money yeah so roblox is
number one three million dollars a day
uh then you got clash of clans in a
distant second
with an estimated 1.8 million dollars of
daily revenue
then candy crush saga would be your
number three
and pokemon go at number four yeah those
are like they don't post they didn't put
how much they make but there is another
number here that is
the top 10 iphone games generate almost
11.2 million daily
yeah this is one of those like great
stats where like okay uh if you were to
separate
you know sometimes remember how we if we
separated just max
from apple yeah just max would be like a
fortune 500 company just because of how
much revenue they make from max
i feel like if you just separated the
top 5 to 10
games on the app store by itself
that company by itself 11 million a day
we do the math that's
yeah a lot of money now so the first
thing i thought of this
when you posted this is we've talked so
much about apple taking 30 percent
i had to crunch the numbers um because
what's 30 of 11.2 million that means
apple
in profits just from sell i mean it
sounds weird to say just from selling
this they're clearly doing other work
they're doing customer support and
processing transactions and everything
but they're making 3.3
million daily and profits just off the
estimated top
10 games i mean we're talking hundreds
of thousands of apps on the app store
right yeah
but there's a couple wild couple huge
ones that just make them a ton of money
well you know what good for apple good
for good for apple for building such a
massive app store that they can afford
to
just give that platform to everyone but
yeah wow that's a lot of money
good for them good for roblox actually i
didn't realize it had that much
that much active user base uh all right
we want to talk about twitter blue
though
okay so twitter blue how do i describe
twitter blue
i've been asking for a bunch of paid
features actually from twitter for a
long time
and i'm still sort of hunting for some
of those
premium features that i would like as a
creator but
as of right now twitter has announced
their subscription service called
twitterblue
and they're starting to roll it out and
we're hoping
maybe at least i was hoping maybe
editing
your tweets after a brief period would
be one of the features
for those who are already typing into
your keyboards why it's such a bad idea
to allow editing tweets you can watch my
dear twitter video
where i explain exactly how i think
editing tweets should work which was
you know it should be a very limited
amount of time they are able to edit
tweets it's a limited amount of
characters you're allowed to change and
tweets show a change log in a history so
change logic it's huge
if it tweets changed then you know if i
retweeted something and it gets changed
obviously i can
i can see that anyway uh so what does
twitter blue
allow for twitter blue will cost about
3.49 canadian or 449 australian per
month
so we're guessing well i'm not good at
conversions but i'm thinking that's
around
three dollars a month usd it's only only
available on those two because those are
the two
only two regions it's out in right right
where it's launching
it gives you a bookmark folders feature
to let you group
save tweets to make them easier to find
later
do you save tweets not really no like
if we ever really need them we
screenshot them for like a video or
something but i don't think i've ever
saved a tweet i didn't know you could
save a tweet i also use pocket
for free oh so adam was just teaching me
about that the other day i've never
heard of it before but yeah so that's
free
there's also reader mode which lets you
keep up with threads by turning them
into an easy to read group of text and
mashing all the tweets together into one
page
that i think that's kind of interesting
but
for a reason that to me makes no sense
for paying
um i've i have friends that just don't
use twitter and when i try and
show them a tweet thread they're super
confused and have no idea who's
responding to who and if you just never
use twitter i kind of get it
i i know it's like we use it we're used
to it um especially when you bring in
retweeting because then it's like
here's the thing they're replying to the
thing underneath them
and then there's people replying to the
thing above the retweet
under that but so this would make sense
to me for people who are not used to
twitter but nobody who's
not used to twitter is going to buy a
twitter subscription yeah you would have
to be
someone who uses twitter a lot who would
want to buy this subscription so they
could share these tweet twitter threads
with people who aren't on twitter very
much
interesting um uh other twitter blue
features are purely aesthetic
adds a new color theme option as well as
the ability to change
the color of twitter's app icon and it
gives you
an undo feature we have it we have edit
tweets there it is
okay so that's it what do you want
this undo feature so it doesn't actually
it's kind of like undo send in gmail
where
it says it will let you within 30
seconds undo a tweet
and that undo tweet is not deleting the
tweet you just sent
it just never sent your tweet so my
whole thing is when you make a typo
you don't really realize you made a typo
right away even if you proofread
nobody's perfect everyone likes to go
proofreader tweets obviously yes we try
to proofread our tweets do you think
people
who tweet all the time just don't
proofread their teeth
sometimes stuff slips through you don't
catch it somebody tweets at you hey
you meant to say this word instead of
that word this autocorrect got you this
time
and so because of that reply that i got
really quick i'll go up
i caught it and i wish i could just edit
the tweet but i'll have to delete it
and then re-post and and hopefully
that's all fine
um with twitter blue if you tweet the
thing
and then nobody replies because it
hasn't been sent yet you're not
gonna catch the typo that you didn't
catch while you were proofreading it and
then it's going to go out
and then it's going to see the typo and
then you still can't yeah
exact same scenario it's like you said
people make
mistakes and like i've proofread things
multiple times and sometimes like even
in the proofreading process you already
know what you're reading
so in your head you're basically reading
exactly how you meant to type yeah
and it's really easy to miss type of
instead of off
or if you type the wrong there like
you're saying it in your minds quickly
it's really easy to miss and then the
first 20 comments when you post it
are you used the wrong word of the wrong
there yeah
i just uh i was just at my high school
for a
ceremony and didn't realize until i saw
my old yearbook that i had a high school
yearbook quote i think that's why i
thought of of and
there's a typo in that high school
yearbook quote i didn't do that on
purpose
i was a pretty good academic student
actually i can't remember when i made
that quote or decided to use that quote
but i uh
it said off instead of of was that even
my typo
yeah that person who typed it just wrote
it wrong there's also an extra space in
there for some reason
i don't know um the point being i can
already see all the comments about like
just proofreader tweets yeah well
mister you've never made a typo in your
life that would work or misses
it's great for you you don't need this
feature but for the rest of us mere
mortals we would like
just the ability to add and edit a few
characters how much would you pay
for a full-blown exactly how you
explained it edit tweet button okay
just for this one feature because
there's a couple other features i really
like that
there's a couple other features i would
like in twitter blue that i would
actually pick
i like to hear them and i'll go over
those but if you could just give me
this ability to edit a few characters in
a tweet that i've been asking for
i would pay at least 10 bucks a month
just for that wow
i'm a heavy twitter user i know that's a
higher number than most people would
give
i i pay that much for unlimited songs in
spotify i pay that much for
basically an endless library of ad-free
videos on youtube
i would pay that much just to be able to
edit you know it's as much as i think
that's a high number i think it is most
important for people who
are would almost consider that a
business expense because
editing like deleting a tweet and and
then reposting it
isn't really a big deal for the majority
of twitter users but if you're someone
with a large following
you're potentially literally deleting
hundreds of comments within the first
minute or two and while a lot of those
will
just point out the typo like that's it's
an engagement hit that kind of stinks
yeah yeah
so that's uh there's other things that
would be yeah i want to know what else
you want
would want and what is the like what is
the like tier three
payment per month to get literally
everything you want oh god okay so we're
talking about twitter business at this
point
yeah definitely i would pay for higher
quality image processing
that is coming right uh so currently you
do have
really good uh pn i think it's png
processing and it's uncropped images on
twitter and that's nice
i would just pay for like a universal
like high quality processing i would
actually pay for this on
several platforms like youtube priority
processing i would already
love that but yeah i would pay for high
quality
universal like unpre uncompressed not
uncompressed but really good processing
images that would be great for someone
like me who uploads a lot of high
quality files especially thumbnails
and i would i would probably want
let me pick one more good idea here
well that would be great i'm pretty sure
we all just took new headshots
in the studio for like our profile
pictures and all of them
just got destroyed mainly where you want
high quality uploading it just
absolutely destroys if you've ever
looked at your own twitter banner
it's been ruined yeah it's been ruined
and your profile youtube banners also
are
really i get it they have to be all over
the place but like
come on yeah it looks pretty rough so
like the features you have here in
twitter blue are
like okay but honestly totally should be
built in for free to twitter like
they're not
that special or serious um so
i would not if it was available here i
would not be paying
twitter blue i do think there's one
other thing that could kind of fall in
the like
quote-unquote business aspect of this
payment is that there's like
some sort of advanced customer service
if you do do twitter blue so if you need
help
i'm assuming copyright stuff or
or harassment or imitation and things
like that
i must i'm guessing you would have a
little quicker jump to the line on
trying to figure stuff like that out so
that actually could be beneficial
it's just not fun like it's not a fun
you're not excited to pay three dollars
a month for that yeah i guess this is a
this is a fair introductory price um
it's
lame but i'm not i'm not paying for it
sorry yeah it's not the one
uh what else i have one more article
that i
i kind of read this morning because i
heard about it yesterday and i just
thought it was
kind of interesting it's pretty quick
though okay um so yesterday morning
around 5
30 our time so we probably 5 30 a.m our
time so we probably didn't even notice
this but
um huge websites went offline
uh reddit twitch and even amazon were
down for like a little bit and it's
apparently because of
they all go through this web platform
called fastly
and i guess fastly was having some
issues well the verge posted an article
this morning that i'll put in the show
notes um
it was actually fastly came out with a
comment saying that it was triggered by
one singular user
and it was accidental they were it
they quote was triggered by a valid
customer configuration change
on their end so this customer is trying
to configure something different with
their
like completely legal thing we're doing
the right thing but they didn't update
in mid-may
and for whatever reason this
configuration change hitting that new
update
caused this massive bug that shut the
entire
i don't know if it was the entire
platform down or something
specific but if you're shutting down
amazon reddit twitch like
so something big went down and we're
past like one singe or
that's a rough buck i guess
i think the verge's like subline was
actually just like fess up who was it we
want to know
um but it even got to the point where
some uh
uk government sites were actually on the
same platform and they were taken down
and people were like having trouble
accessing like government things they
had to turn in it's funny because
sometimes
you know large swathes of the internet
all go down at once because they all use
the same services like aws or something
amazon's web services a lot of sites use
that and as soon as
aws goes down for a little bit a lot of
websites
all at once don't work or barely work
for a while
um so it's kind of funny that amazon
would be one of the
large sites to go down because there's
someone else's services
and twitch is owned by amazon i guess i
don't know exactly what fastly does
um but yeah i i just thought it was
crazy that someone
uh you see i mean usually when you see
those places go down though it's a
targeted attack and they like explain
that's the target attack they have to
figure it out and try and stop it but
this was just
some poor customer like imagine calling
back like oh yeah that bug you
you inherit like figured out the other
day or you couldn't make your
configuration change yeah you took down
amazon in the process
and some uk government websites yeah at
5 30 in the morning
that's a pretty brutal mistake to make
sick
bragging rights i think i guess yeah i
just thought that was pretty funny
all right we gotta talk about wwdc the
worldwide developers conference here's
the thing about wwdc
we have seen hardware at wwdc before
sort of right sometimes it gets unveiled
which get people's expectations really
high
but it is a developer conference like
google i o and like others so
we can't be shocked when there isn't
hardware yeah i mean this was an
entirely software show
yeah i'm always surprised when people
say they're like underwhelmed by it but
it's like
it's a developer conference you're not
going to get some crazy stuff what was
it last year
they mentioned m1 or m1 max but
not like specifically the the product
based on it so it's like
kind of a hardware announcement the mac
pro got an unveiling at wwdc like that
was cool
just an unveiling like we didn't get to
buy it that day or anything but
this was just software so but we want to
go through all these because apple makes
a lot of software they make ios they
make
watch os they make ipad os they make mac
os
they make home kit they make everything
in between so
they updated pretty much all this stuff
we could just start with ios 15 right
that's the that's the yeah i think
that's usually the big one the fun one
we're smartphone reviewers that's
usually uh
that's fair this is what this is what
we'll see on the iphone
in september or whenever the newest
iphone the 13 comes out
this is what will like launch on the new
iphone and
i'll be honest there was a lot of stuff
i think there's a lot of good stuff and
a lot of really thoughtful updates
put into ios 15 both some some of which
that i was expecting some of which
i saw and i was like oh that's an
interesting idea i didn't think they
would do that like the facetime stuff
uh matter of fact let's start with the
facetime stuff so facetime got a bunch
of like smaller things and then a couple
big things
yeah i think one was like spatial audio
added to it so
you can kind of make it feel like you're
more in the room i guess with people it
sounds
fine sounded like one of those things
that's like kind of cool but you won't
really use too much
yeah it'll also have a portrait mode so
you can turn on blurring your background
which we've seen in others like zoom
you can just blur your background i felt
in the actual announcement
the example they were using like the
edge of detection wasn't that great
her like whole shoulder was kind of like
weirdly
i don't know it was a little off i have
i have never seen
good live video portrait mode yeah
exactly
so i'm not shocked that it doesn't look
that great if you have you ever tried
zoom's
automatic background blur it is
hilariously bad
like it'll generally work because it'll
cut you out because you can see your
outline but like
you'll turn your head to the side it'll
just leave like a blotch that's not
blurred out
that's the thing is like zooms i didn't
know they had that but it makes sense
because they have to like replace
background but
generally when you're replacing the
background you kind of understand this
is already a meme and i'm okay with
moving my arm and it just appearing out
of the beach
and the like sunset i have set behind me
um
so yeah i i i'm not expecting that to be
great i don't expect many people to
use it really either there's a couple
other features that i think i'll tie
in that i could see people using all at
once
but yeah it's just kind of like a thing
you can turn on if you want to yeah uh
share play this is a cool one to me i
didn't think this was cool so
with shareplay you know how you can
screen share inside of zoom or screen
share inside of google meet or screen
share inside of skype or skim insurance
live teams or screen share inside of
whatever you're using
uh instead of just screen sharing
something you can actually all pull up
the same content at once by using share
play
so if you have apple music or a tv show
or apple tv or something like that or
since there's an api now any one of the
supporting services
you can all be watching the same content
at once
i say all because you could have a
multi-person facetime and
it'll all be synced up for all of you so
you know how people do this thing where
they'll like facetime each other and
then
watch yep a movie at the same time
my family and stuff especially during
the pandemic like yeah
you are making up ways to do things with
people yeah now
you can watch the movie on your phone or
watch it on your apple tv
while you're face timing and so you'll
have the same playback controls and
you'll be able to fast forward and pause
for everyone at the same time and
everything stays in sync that's pretty
cool i think that's really neat that's
pretty cool
you can screen share now inside of
facetime as well which is obviously
very useful for family tech support
shout out to fellow family tech support
i'm with you guys i understand the
struggle is real but now you can
you can screen share so you can like
show people how to do things which is
cool
um and now also facetime
is available for android
that's definitely going to be the clip
title for
100 yeah kind of barely i mean facetime
links it'll work this is the easier way
honestly i think i can say that facetime
is available for android like
it'll functionally do almost all the
same stuff you can't initiate a facetime
call from android but
if you start a facetime call or schedule
a facetime call you can send people
a link to that facetime call where they
can join if they open it on their iphone
it'll open in facetime
if they open it on the web from their
android phone or from their
windows desktop for example they can
still join the facetime call yeah so
you can join literally a facetime from
android
and they use the ugliest possible
android phone
in their little facetime demo on stage
and on their website to this day i don't
know what phone that's supposed to be
but hey you can now hop onto facetime on
android which is a
i never thought i'd really say that yeah
right i i wasn't expecting that
it is like a kind of sideway of doing it
like it's not
actually facetime for android but the
fact that you can still
do it and honestly most people who are
like having facetime calls and trying to
get a relative or a friend
on it like sending them the link is
probably the easiest way of doing it
rather than making them download
facetime and everything so i mean
there's never gonna be a facetime app
for android that's never going to happen
yeah
but if there was like that one family
member who has an android phone who's
been left out of all the holiday group
facetimes because he doesn't have a mac
or whatever
well now he's in now you're now they're
in now they can uh
like they can join the facetime as well
which is exciting but to me all this
stuff to together
feels like apple sort of responding to
how often we see this like work from
home type culture or basically everyone
doing everything virtually now
we're like people are very familiar with
zoom like zoom didn't really have a
place
in everyday life until 2020
