hello world welcome back
to the waveform podcast we're your
robots i'm marquez it's happening and
i'm andrew
and in today's episode we're talking uh
well we just got samsung's unpacked
event this week so we're gonna talk a
lot about my real thoughts on the z fold
three and the z flip three but we also
have a couple other things that we're
gonna just dive into quickly beforehand
before we get absolutely lost in the in
the weeds of all those new folding
flippy phones um
but first this morning we had a little
iphone thing come up yeah
i was like a little confused because you
just you like turned to me and went
do you really think they're gonna skip
iphone 13 because it's unlucky and i was
just like
that was way too nonchalant you can't
just say that to me who who wants to
skip it who where these rumors come from
i've only ever heard the term iphone 13
yeah well i mean i guess it could be 12s
is the other option
and but the
the logic is that
some other smartphone companies in the
past have skipped certain numbers for
various reasons one plus and four one
plus and notably a bunch of chinese
companies avoid the number four because
the translated number four is
like sounds like the word for death or
something like that and it's it's not
just unlucky but they just avoid that
and like all press and naming of things
in those countries so cool great uh but
also like people skip numbers all the
time like samsung went galaxy s one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven
twenty twenty one
so
i mean
apple has skipped nine they just went
straight from exactly they did eight and
10 x whatever you want to call it yeah
um
i don't know my
i have a couple things you've mentioned
before that ios has a 13. so clearly
apple isn't that worried yeah 13 by the
way for those unfamiliar is an unlucky
number in the us anyway it's like a it's
sort of a mild superstition type thing
13 is unlucky oh okay
but yeah there are other apple products
with the number 13 already in the name i
noted that none of them are hardware
products yeah we have ios 13.
uh i think joanna stern also pointed out
on twitter we have a 13-inch macbook pro
i would argue that was not quite as but
like yeah even still even though it's
not hardware like
software being named 13 if they were
really that superstitious about it they
would skip it yeah um
12s also doesn't solve the problem
because there would still be a 13 when
we saw the 6s we still saw a seven so
it's still going to get to 13 so it
doesn't really matter
and
while i
i didn't really hear this rumor at all
um there was an end gadget article that
stated nobody's expecting it to be
called the iphone 13 for obvious reasons
i thought that maybe that was sarcasm
really broad i
i don't know we need a sarcasm like a
circus
or something exactly
but like
i guess my argument would just be
if we want to go a little different here
i think the new iphone should be called
the 12s and you think that because of
the logical reason which is it is a
small upgrade from the 12. it is a small
upgrade with
what we're assuming is all the same
design language so i know there was
argument that the 11 should be called
the 11s but i do think there is enough
of a design difference to where you held
i mean flat edges sure but i do think
they looked pretty different like there
are two that you can very easily and
distinguishably tell the difference when
you're holding them or see them in
public at least without a case on
very different whereas this if we're
assuming it's going to keep i mean if it
looks like the models that we got flat
edges the cameras are ever so slightly
different
but other than that if the notch maybe
the notch changes a little bit
i think
we're not introducing anything too new
that we know of yet 12s would make
perfect sense yeah i mean at this point
the difference in designs versus iphones
is always pretty subtle yeah and i've
noticed apple i mean everyone's noticed
this but apple always has something on
the outside of the phone to make it
visibly identifiable as the new iphone
like when you saw the iphone 10
obviously you had that new form factor
in the notch but then when you had the
iphone 11 well 10s was the same body yes
so there was no outside difference when
you got to 11 the camera bump became
that thing yep so everyone could see the
camera bump when you got to 12 the flat
sides became that thing it was a
slightly new design yeah so if we're
expecting iphone 12s or 13 or whatever
the next one is to be the same design
then your logic makes sense
but i think they're just going to
straight up stop doing that adjustment
and they're just going to start doing
number number number iphone 12
13 14 15 and the s is done they're going
to do an sc probably still but they're
going to do a pro and a pro max and all
that stuff every year i think that
they should do that because 12 s pro max
is too weird i i mean
that's the logic yeah no i don't can't
argue with you there i think it should
be the best way because apple we've
always commended as being one of the
like the best naming scheme because it's
so simple and adding s especially when
you also have s e
feels confusing to the average person so
you should just know
the next number up is the newest one
yeah like that's all you need to know s
doesn't mean small s doesn't mean
like side grader i don't know it's just
like the new one is the next number
that's all it is and i
i don't think they skipped 13 at all i
don't know if that's a hot date but i
really i would bet money against that
yeah i think it's the 13. uh we had some
people saying maybe it would be uh just
the new iphone or something like that x
iii
is that roman numeral room for 13 yeah
yeah that would be and that would be xiv
for 14. but you know the thing about
like just calling it the new iphone if i
could go back to that it could it could
work because in ipad world that's also
what they do it's the ipad pro and if
you ever want to refer to it
specifically you can by year so
the newest ipad pro the 2021 ipad pro
versus the last gen maybe you refer to
it by the chip
you have the m1 ipad pro versus the a14
by ipad pro nobody really says these
things out loud but usually it's just
the newest ipad pro
and iphone could live in that world
where it's just the newest iphone the
2021 iphone the 2022 iphone but the
reason i don't think they do that is
because the naming structure of the
iphone is a little bit too iconic to
just drop that entirely yeah i think you
change phones a little more often than
you do
macbooks tablets stuff like that so like
especially in a resale market where
phones are resold so easily it just
makes the resale market much easier to
know what you're getting imagine like
going on ebay and looking for the uh the
iphone
10 except that it was just called like
the iphone
20 from the year yeah exactly like that
just makes it so much harder
yeah that's probably about all there is
to say about that it's iphone coming up
in uh september if it's not delayed
we're expecting to see that pretty soon
and that being said i don't i think it
should be called 12s i think it will be
if i put money on it it would be 13
though right right just from what i
expect from apple i have a kind of new
one that got released a new
article a new product that got released
this morning or announced this morning i
saw you like
firing away at your keyboard over there
and i have no idea what you're talking
about but it has something to do with
chrome os okay i'll fill me in i'll go
in here i this was something adam sent
us this morning and at first i was like
neat and then i read it and i was like i
actually find this wildly interesting
and like this i think is is really
really cool and it's i kind of have a
hot take on it which i think would makes
it that great but i'll explain it a
little bit more here um so hp is
creating a chrome os desktop they're
calling it the chrome aio desktop which
means all-in-one um oh god i put a
picture here i'm gonna try and explain
it tell me if you think this sounds nice
imagine a
the first google home has a cone
and then on top of that is almost like
an ipad so a screen so we have
essentially imagine an all-in-one
desktop where it is the base is like a
fabric covered cone speaker and then
there's a large
screen tablet looking thing on top oh it
rotates it rotates portrait to landscape
and it has a webcam and it also has a
wireless keyboard and mouse so
this is a chrome os based desktop it is
real quick i'm going to go over specs
but i think i just have like
i'm just really interested in this
because i think chrome os and
chromebooks in general are super
interesting and like kind of
revolutionary in a weird way um so it is
21.5 inch 1080
uh ips touch screen that rotate rotates
from landscape to portrait we mentioned
that you can either get a dual core
pentium gold or a core i3 16 gigs of
user expandable ram and an ssd up to 256
now let's just remember
specs on chrome os and like chromebooks
in general are pretty
low because they don't take a lot of
computing power if you're using them
it's generally all web-based stuff yes
um and like apps because it uses the
play store so but
okay so i i just want to
look at the price real quick yeah 600
dollars
so 600 for a desktop with a 21 inch
1080p touchscreen is like
kind of nice solid um you said pentium
gold
dual core pentium gold or uh core i3 is
definitely on the lower end but then 16
gigs and a 250 68 ssd is on the higher
end so okay 16 gigs is on the higher end
256 ssd is it's like definitely i would
call that lower and ssd if it was like
nvme or actually
it just listed ssd i don't know what i
guess uh hard drives should be gone hard
drives i shouldn't give you credit for
not using it don't yeah okay
all right so i'm with you so far i think
i'm with you so far chrome os only so
it's going to have auto rotate but
obviously it's just chrome so you're
going to be using chrome you need as
much ram as you can get so yeah lots of
lots of ram chrome os i think i'm with
you so like
in my eyes chromebooks are pretty
amazing because so many people who get a
laptop are only using it for like web
browsing watching youtube if they're
doing schoolwork they're doing it in
google docs answering emails like almost
everyone who comes to me that i know
isn't a big tech person that asks for a
laptop recommendation i almost always
just suggest a chromebook because
they're so they're 300 bucks usually
they'll last a decent amount of time
maybe not as long as a regular laptop
but it's also 300 it's like a third of
the price of a macbook it's definitely
been the best part for me about
recommending a chromebook it's if i can
ask you what programs you need to use
and you answer that question in websites
i can give you a chrome chrome exactly
you're going to go gmail you're going to
go you know google search youtube and
netflix and all these things it's like
oh great yeah you can definitely use a
chromebook here's something half the
price of what you thought you're going
to have to exactly i bought claire one
at costco years ago and it's still
running and it's she still uses it every
day um so here's my kind of hot take on
this um okay all right i think this
might make a lot of people mad which is
kind of why it's a hot take but just
hear me out here okay
i think
this pulls off the category the newest
imacs tried to get into
better than the newest imax so like
let's think about how apple
sold the latest imax right we did those
bright colors they were an all-in-one
stand with their screen they sold this
as this is a computer we want you to put
as a family computer in the common areas
of your house your living room your
kitchen your family room stuff like that
for the family to use most likely
generally web-based stuff watching
youtube videos they want it in the
kitchen so you might watch
cooking videos or pull up recipes or be
able to facetime with someone yep
but all of that was in a
you know that doesn't have touch screen
i mean sure the specs on the imac are
way better than this it runs apple all
that but i don't think that's all needed
for the thing it's trying to sell it as
this is a good looking it looks good it
looks like it could run
like in your family room whatever it's
not sticking out like a sore thumb like
a big desktop tower is it has touch
screen and rotates so it's easy for
video calls or pulling up long
recipes or something like that in your
kitchen it has a wireless keyboard and
mouse nice and easy looks like it has a
speaker on the base
to me this looks like an easier and
most of all way cheaper
i'd be much i'd much rather pay 600
bucks to put this in my kitchen and be
like a dedicated i'm in the kitchen i'm
using it to facetime not facetime video
calls you could facetime sure yeah
video call i'm using it for recipes i'm
using it to just like
watch videos or something like that
while i'm in my kitchen this looks like
it pulls that off better than the imac
you know what you you swayed me you sold
me i think i buy it the only oh
interesting thing yeah one more one more
argument okay it also uses android apps
via the play store so this is a way
better thing for smart home control in
your living room in your kitchen stuff
like that you can download all i mean it
obviously has google assistant and you
can download all your different smart
home control apps in it so now you have
a rotating or whatever touch screen in
your living room in your kitchen that
you're now controlling your lights
you're controlling your nest you're
controlling all your general smart home
stuff through that looking at your nest
cameras and stuff like that yeah yeah
it's funny when i remember reviewing the
imac and thinking like oh apple is very
very
almost hell-bent on making sure we
understand that this is not just a
normal computer it's supposed to be your
family room everyday multi-purpose like
friendly computer
and
and actually like the way this one looks
better i think it's got the fabric on
the stand then it's got black bezels and
it it actually rotates which is really
interesting i don't know
i don't know exactly what i would rotate
my desktop to portrait four all the time
i think the fact that you can do it is
cool
um in some of those scenarios like say a
recipe for example now i'm getting more
screen real estate because a recipe
doesn't really benefit from
lengthwise real estate but if you have a
list of ingredients you are benefiting
there or uh some people even like it
better for like video calls yeah
sometimes portrait is a little different
especially if you're a video calling
someone on a phone it's just going to
that's going to be the standard
aspect ratio or whatever that they're
probably using anyways so it fits better
the one thing i would still give the
advantage to apple for and this is kind
of something they continually do anyway
in all of their budget products is it's
overpowered to the point where it's just
going to be way more future-proof than
anything else in his class now the imac
is still a thousand dollars it's still
more expensive than this but if i were
to bet which one is going to get
software updates and run smoothly for
longer it's definitely the imac kind of
the same way the iphone se
is like an impressive chip in an older
body but it's going to get software
updates and run smoothly probably just
as long if not longer than any other
android phone in its price category so
it's kind of about what you want but i
buy your hot take that's much better
than my hot tech with fahrenheit last
time so i think it's a good one i will
say my one con i put put on here is
generally be and this is anecdotal
evidence but chrome books i've thought
don't have as long of a lifetime
especially compared to apple products so
i definitely agree with you and i think
we all agree i'm not trying to say this
is more powerful than an imac no i think
generally the imac for a sit-down
computer blows us out of the water but
the fact that it adds a rotating screen
and touchscreen makes it seem like more
of a
home almost not even a computer it's
like bridging its gap into just like
being part of your space at home better
than imac does imac is still a computer
and you have to use it as a computer yep
it's mac os do you
in a in a family room computer is a
touch screen the move
so i i see it as that when i think of it
as like
so the kitchen scenario works the best
here because
a lot of times in a like when i think
about imac talking saying put it in your
kitchen like you still have a keyboard
and a mouse i can't imagine having like
stuff out on my countertop
chopping and measuring and and washing
stuff off while also using a keyboard
and mouse there this that gets pushed
away i have my touch screen i can scroll
through everything yes but your hands
are covered in stuff that you were
chopping but we all use our phones doing
that anyways yeah i'm not that worried
about that um and and then when it's in
the living room you know
i don't personally have a computer in my
living room i haven't i mean growing up
i had one i feel it's crazy now that
everyone has computers on their own when
they're children um we generally used to
have them in the family room where we
couldn't get in trouble on them but um
having in a family room and still having
the ability to control your music or
control your smart home stuff by just
like walking past the desks and pressing
a couple buttons on the screen yeah that
does feel like it integrates a tad
better than an imac makes sense i like
it well i'm gonna keep an eye out for it
i don't know that we're gonna end up
getting one but i kind of like that
there are pretty sick desktops out there
now i'm really terrible terrible name
absolutely awful name
uh chrome aio
is that how you say it ai chrome hey i'm
i'm guessing it's literally just the
letters a i o i o
a o a o a i o a
not going to say it out loud
but that's uh that's it for the chrome
os samsung has had their unpacked event
where uh it kind of kicks off smartphone
season for us usually around this time
of year because i feel like the
floodgates have just began
to open we're about to get a bunch of
phones in august even more in september
even more in october but it's the
samsung event two folding phones also
two watches also some galaxy buds too
galaxy buds two pretty small update but
they do have anc and they're 150 bucks
and they're very smooth they look like
easter candy they're extremely smooth
yeah or at least the purple ones and
then they got two watches the uh sort of
a classic version and a modern version
of a similar spec with the new software
but i think we're just gonna talk about
the phones for right now because there
are plenty of thoughts on these two so
which one you want to start with we have
the fold three and we have the flip
three
let's just start with fold
okay fold three four three all right so
fold three looks a lot like the fold two
we've done by the way video hands-on of
both of them are already up by the time
you see this and we've got the phones in
hand uh but yeah it's uh it looks very
similar to the fold two but there's a
bunch of really interesting choices that
they made
new specs is not a surprise snapdragon
812 gigs of ram and all the specs
but uh a couple things they changed on
the outside number one
you've got a almost the same outside
cover screen but it's 120 hertz
that is nice i remember complaining and
being a little bit jarred by switching
back and forth between 60 and 120 yeah
that was the biggest thing is that it
wasn't continuous between the phone like
it wasn't fluid between them they made
that majestic update on the inside and
the outside was still 60. so now it's
120 and i really liked using it felt
like a normal phone obviously it's still
a big candy bar shape but that's a good
upgrade didn't you say it's also like
18 pixels
larger than last year yeah it is it is a
weird it is uh i want to pull up let me
pull up the exact number because it is
kind of funny
technically we do have a different
resolution hold on it was like a low
enough number to the point where
i don't know where
where it could have gained those pixels
i think it's maybe literally just like
rounding of the corners either rounding
off corners or my guess was like the
hole punch
uh it's the same whole point i mean okay
here's the here's the numbers fold two
cover screen 6.2 inches 2260 by 816
fold three 6.2 inches 2268
832.
so the pixels per inch went from 386 to
387. it's like 32 more pixels right 16
and 16. it said no 8 and
taller and about a dozen pixels wide
yeah wow yeah that's it 20 pixels so
yeah basically the same size 6.2 inch
covers i want to know those exact new
pixels we got yeah i'm not sure where
they came from but there they are um i
really like the new hinge is much better
it's a strengthened solid aluminum now
um i think they call it armored aluminum
i'm not gonna give them too much credit
for it it's metal yeah thanks but the
phone is now ipx8 water resistant
i don't know about you but i thought
this was really cool i thought that was
a big deal but it's not
exactly that's exactly how i felt when
you explained it to me thank you okay so
it's ipx8 not ip68
so immediately like wow amazing water
resistance that's crazy usually these
these folding phones are also concerned
about like don't breathe on it too hard
and suddenly you can dip it under water
and it's fine
but
ipx8 means the eight the eight if you
just break down what ipx8 means the
eight is the water resistance part the x
is for dust resistance they have not
tested or certified the dust resistance
so real quick is that true in all phones
with ip ratings the first number is dust
the second number is water correct okay
yeah that that was a very helpful thing
that i did not know about but the video
shows it's a little harder to say for
audio listeners but yeah right
x is the first quote-unquote number and
it is x because it is not rated and a is
the rating for water because it's the
second number so you see a lot of like
headphones or like ipx5 that's just
because it's a lower level of water
resistance ipx8 means you can literally
like submerge it or like you know spray
water on it from any angle and it'll
survive so that's great uh but the
nemesis
you already know some youtube channel is
going to put it underwater and it's
going to see how long before it turns
off and i get it i'll watch it i think
that's cool
but yeah uh the thing that's been
damaging folding phones
and giving them the bad reputation is
the dust and david and i were talking
about this we're like well if it was
going to be
fully airtight they would have rated it
for dust resistance they would have
tried to prevent that so clearly i think
you know obviously them paying and
getting it certified makes me want to be
happier about its durability but i'm not
going to go all out on a limb and say
these phones are a next level of
durability versus previous folding
phones i just think the hinge is that
much more airtight that they can finally
certify it but still be careful with it
it is really interesting that
what like somehow water can't get in but
dust
potentially could get in
just get in fighting about that fine
dust like really fine particles i mean
and like you said dust has kind it
sounds weird to say dust is the enemy of
folding phones but like do you remember
when those first ones came out so many
of the problems that happened were
somebody would just see like a little
bump in their screen and wonder what is
that
something got through the hinge
underneath the screen and then that
screen was generally broken fairly
quickly afterwards yeah it's the kiss of
death it's just a little little bit of
dust that's all it takes
um it just made me think of zack's video
where he like ground up a bunch of uh
that was rough it was never going to
survive that so but you know you do have
ipx8 now um like 120 hertz on the
outside what else new camera bump on the
back is a little bit smaller but it is a
refreshed triple camera setup good to
see we'll test it of course for the full
review
slightly thinner
two millimeters thinner and about 10
grams lighter for the whole phone
it still like feels the same to my hands
like it's a nice like solid stiff hinge
and all that is great um but that does
mean it has a slightly smaller battery 4
400 milliamp hours to 4500
and uh i mentioned that because i'm i'm
curious what the battery life is going
to be i am very interested now you have
a 120 hertz on the outside
so we'll see what the battery life is
like and we'll test that but 4 400.
but i think the the most interesting
change is on the inside i think that's a
safe that's a safe statement i mean it's
the fold it's literally a phone call
based around the the inside yes that's a
cold take uh so the inside the crease is
just as as relevant it's basically the
same size and resolution and aspect
ratio and 120 hertz and all that
but
you have a 30
harder screen protector over the glass
cool yeah it's great cool um
they've also made it s pen compatible
big asterisk
yeah okay explain the asterisks and then
i'll say my take on that so so there's a
there's a special new s pen for the
galaxy fold that's the it's the s pen
fold edition actually um
yeah the way the s pen is designed is it
has a soft it has a tip the way a normal
stylus tip will be a fine point but it's
it's soft touch and it actually retracts
into the pen when you put enough
pressure on it okay so the easiest way
to damage one of these is to really
carve like with a fine tip hanging in
the screen protector so this one is
designed to prevent that from happening
it's a special s pen for this phone
um s pen fold edition then there's also
a new these are both optional by the way
i was gonna say these are optional not
included with the phone but there's also
a new s pen
uh pro i believe it's called
and it's bigger it's more expensive it
has a battery built in it charges via
usbc and it has on-board memory
and it will let you copy and paste
things between samsung devices i thought
that was pretty cool that is one of
those things that i think is awesome and
almost no one will use i i'm sure
somebody is like
freaking out and their workflow just got
way way easier and they're super hyped
and i'm super happy for you i can't see
myself ever using it but i think it's
really cool there's some people on the
ecosystem who have a samsung phone and a
samsung tablet or samsung laptop and
this is going to be sweet
um but that pen has a literal physical
hardware switch on it to switch between
regular s pen mode and galaxy fold mode
and i actually when i was just in the
the shooting area was spending my first
hours with the phone i didn't flip that
switch and i went right to like trying
to pair it with the phone and a warning
popped up i think because maybe the
phone realized somehow recognized that i
was poking it with a stylist of some
kind and i put that warning in the video
it literally says like hey don't use
styluses that aren't fold compatible
if you do use an s pen pro flip it to s
pen uh flip it to fold mode and so i
flipped it and then you know retracts
more easily and then it works that's
what it does it retracts it so easily
yeah okay
um yeah i think i mean
i think you put it a little lightly
saying that the um and you were just
explaining but you were saying how the
folds generally its worst enemy besides
dust has been little nicks in the screen
and we've seen especially on the fold
one it got better in the fold too but i
still think it was a an issue around
there is like you could basically carve
out
pieces of the screen like it would
indent and then that screen's
it's flexible it's fragile it's like
that's really bad people were doing it
with their fingernails that's the first
one so like to introduce s-pen to me
seems like a really bold move
it automatically makes me think maybe i
mean if i'm being optimistic about it it
makes me think the screen has gotten a
lot better at least a lot more durable
um because i don't see why they would
ever bring it upon themselves to
introduce another way of
the full breaking like why would you
want to go through those headlines again
yeah um so they must be pretty confident
we're assuming that this retractable
thing works all the time i can see the
time it doesn't or you know people are
messy
something gets in there that s pen uh
tip gets stuck and now you're all of a
sudden carving into your eighteen
hundred dollar phone we haven't
mentioned the price yet eighteen hundred
dollars that's
yeah still very expensive obviously i my
take on this is samsung
knows
that not very many people will be buying
both this phone and the optional s pen
and so that small group of people who do
will take good care of it because you at
that point have to buy the phone
buy the s pen maybe buy the case so you
can carry around the thing with the
phone does the case hold the pro version
also because the pro version i think so
like 30 to 40 bigger very big bigger big
yeah it's probably one and a half times
the size it's kind of like something
you'd find maybe attached to it's like
an apple pencil like an actual pencil
yeah like how we don't reference real
pencils anymore because no one knows the
size of a real pencil anymore who's
using ticonderone i can't remember the
last time i held a pencil to be
perfectly honest with you i haven't held
a pencil in a long time
um no yeah so it's way bigger i don't
think you're gonna carry that around
with the phone but yeah that person now
has spent so much over two grand i'm
assuming at this point you've bought the
case you bought the phone you bought the
s pen that group of people is gonna take
careful notes and take good care of
their screen and if you really get that
far and start to damage the screen like
what happened something went wrong
samsung's very trustworthy i trustful on
that one yeah i think they did the math
on that um
but yeah it does it is s pen supported
now and i think there's gonna be people
who find that really nice because it's a
bigger canvas than the galaxy note yeah
it's a huge 120 hertz it makes perfect
sense in a ideal scenario it's just i
don't know if i fully would as samsung
have the confidence in it i appreciate
they have the confidence and it yeah
like i said optimistically it makes me
think the screen has gotten more durable
i don't know why they would introduce
that unless it really has this makes me
think the note can't possibly die
the galaxy note can't possibly be dead
after this
i don't know how this you got to that
conclusion
like potentially introducing a different
version of
a different version of the note but
they're like obviously touting the s pen
with this yeah yeah i think it's just
because it's such a workaround it's such
an asterisk a specific fold edition s
pen was made for this like it's a
special pen
a special case needs to be bought for it
a special mode needs to be used on the
other one and like i like that for this
1800 phone they've enabled one more use
case
but it's still very clear to me that the
best stylist experience is the one that
comes from the one that's built into the
phone
i don't see how
the the note dies after this one it's it
just doesn't make mental sense to me i i
still know that the rumors are pointing
to it dying soon and it's crazy but
that's i think what scares me more is
that the rumors aren't even really
talking about it anymore which makes me
think that's way cool that means we're
almost there i s i mean little tangent
we still have a couple things about the
full to talk about but
i think if they really like you know
this big canvas an expensive phone with
an s pen maybe replacing the note the
note should turn into a budget
s stylus option
budget large screen stylus option for
the people that we've talked about in
the past that are using it in a more
blue collar situation where they need
people who need a quick way to
illustrate something in front of
somebody on a job site and and not be a
thousand dollars and not be 1800 like i
don't want to be on in a construction
website or a construction site with a
full then 1800 filled that break where
there's dust everywhere exactly yeah
right yeah um but there is two more
things i have written down that i want
to talk about one is like
very new which is the under screen
selfie camera we have to talk about that
we got a little tangent on the pen there
yeah okay so uh there's multiple
multiple selfie cameras on this phone
yes on this on this folding phone so
you've seen you've probably imagined
this before but on the outside cover
screen there is still a hole punched off
the camera
and if you really really want a high
quality selfie you can unfold it and use
the main cameras as your selfie camera
because the viewfinder is also on the
outside boom easy if you happen to be on
the inside and maybe still want to take
a selfie without closing it at that
point samsung has included underneath
the folding display
a behind the display selfie camera
it is very reminiscent of the first gen
one i looked at about i don't know i
just looked
zt it was this
axon 20. yeah yeah yeah um
the first article i found about it was
end of december 2020 so yeah probably
about six months something like that we
actually got it so that's that was the
first gen we know that a second gen is
coming it should be improved a lot but
it looks a lot like that where number
one it's got this like hexagon shaped
cut out behind the screen it technically
speaking
is better than a hole punch because the
whole punch would just be a black circle
but you know it's it's you drag things
behind that and it's pixelated and
things start to more a little bit and
your eye kind of catches it once in a
while and if you look forward it's there
it's very obviously there especially
off-axis
but it's not quite a hole punch i would
argue when you say better
just to uh visually thank you exactly
visually it is better now the photos it
takes exactly probably worse
so i again this we're speaking
definitely
yeah definitely i think that's safe to
say um no we we have this is on the
backs of like a couple hours of hand on
literally an hour of hands-on time but i
took some selfies with the fold three
and i could actually see it
sort of defogging the photo after i take
it now again this is a fast chip
snapdragon 8 it's taking the photo
quickly but in the video i included a
bit where you hit the shutter
immediately go to look at the photo and
you see the hazy photo and then boom it
adds the contrast and yeah it looks like
you dragged a clarity slide it looks
like you're going to lightroom and
pressing auto and having it fix
everything yeah basically so it's still
doing some work there makes me wonder
what do videos look like if i jump in
like a zoom call on this phone is it
going to be hazy the whole time i don't
know if it's live processing well yeah
because when you look in the viewfinder
it obviously isn't making the
corrections then it looks rough it
doesn't look that great no it looks like
you're looking through like a scratched
piece of plexiglass which
isn't that far off from what it's
actually really doing um
but yeah i
i really feel like my question is why
now
i totally understand i think i have
everything under display i think i have
my own answer but i just wanna yeah so
like i totally understand under display
selfie cameras are a thing they're going
to be a thing i think it's the future it
we're i would say in five years we'll
probably see it in most flagship phones
um just because we're hearing a lot
about it recently if you think about
under display fingerprint sensor those
came to market pretty quick and we see
them in a lot so i wouldn't doubt if
this makes it there that's fair pretty
quickly um
to me
the fold is already such a bleeding edge
phone it feels weird to put this in like
phones we're seeing that in now like the
zte and we just got an announcement that
there's gonna be a new me mix four i
think that should have it those are
phones that we're used to seeing these
like bleaching edge things be the the
headline of the phone the full the fold
folds that's the headline it folds i
like i don't need an under screen finger
selfie camera interesting to be a
headline there yeah so it feels i
totally get that it wants to have an
uninterrupted giant screen yeah that
looks better
it has the other selfie camera i guess
the argument is and like which totally
kills my argument on why is just
you if you're gonna do video calls you
want to do it on the big screen and the
inside yeah and you have to have it
there yeah i you know what's funny maybe
where's the pop-up
i could see a pop-up in there water
resistance though
maybe maybe the folding part of the fold
this is the third fold third generation
of the z-fold
maybe the folding part people are kind
of over it and
i don't i hope not we're not far enough
to be over the full here's the thing
though about like the general crowd
looking at samsung phones and like the
general population who's about to see a
bunch of commercials from samsung most
people have not seen the under display
camera ever maybe we've done a video on
no no no no no no no i totally agree
with that totally there's a there's
another you know mix coming out that'll
have this but most people will go yeah
wait a second it's under the screen and
there's a camera back there i don't know
what the exact reaction is but they
haven't seen this before and so that's
one more crazy cool feature in a phone
that justifies eighteen hundred dollars
because folding in half wasn't enough to
make this thing go mainstream so it's
just one more thing they're tossing it
in there and i think also samsung would
probably tell you
this is the least used selfie camera
like we said we have a hole punch one on
the outside we have the main cameras if
you really want a good selfie and if you
happen to be folded open and want to do
something this will pass it will be
it'll be okay it won't look great
but it'll work
and so you know you get this you know
bleeding edge technology that's in no
other phone anyone's ever seen and
people are going to go man the iphone's
far behind because that's what people do
when they see an unknown feature show up
worms man
that's that's the reaction that i sort
of predict we're gonna see from the
mainstream crowd here's my counter
argument to that and it is a counter
argument for just the sake of argument
there is clearly no real reason to argue
this
for stuff like the fold and people
spending a lot of that money
would you agree that kind of like
showing off this new technology is
definitely a pro to it like i have the
fold my friends see me unfolding a phone
they're obviously going to ask questions
about that yeah
the under display selfie camera goes
against all the flashiness of it by
literally just not being there i highly
doubt somebody you're gonna open the
fold and someone's gonna be like oh my
goodness you don't have a selfie camera
in there yes it's one of those things
you have to like point out to other
people how impressive it is and that
kind of loses the charm of like being
bleeding edge and like having that 1800
phone again there's no reason for that
argument i just uh wanted to toss it out
there yeah it is it is true i would say
all the things you say are true it's
just like a the enthusiast who gets this
phone is going to be like hell yeah
i think that's the best thing it's good
totally marketed at enthusiasts and
they're going to be really hyped about
it until they
see the hazing fingerprint readers still
on the power button by the way
just a regular fingerprint reader around
the power button i think that's fine
could you just total not like under the
screen also alongside i'm still totally
team power button fingerprint reader i
think it's fine i wish so many more
phones did that be honest software
experience generally the same as the
last fold but they've they've obviously
added some uh maybe not obviously but
there's some new features with
multitasking just because this is the
phone that you get if you're gonna
multitask yeah productive so that's what
this is getting oh it's not the duo no
it's not going to do it sorry
i mean you could get the duo but you'd
be waiting a lot longer for everything
to happen um there is a labs feature
that lets you like force apps to
multitask despite their lack of
optimized aspect ratio it's in a lab
section so you can turn it on if you
want okay um i really like the side dock
so samsung's been doing this like slide
out side dock thing for like a long time
since the first uh
came first edge came first okay yeah and
this is a lot of years ago but you slide
it out and you get this useful you know
panel of apps maybe but also you could
have like a compass over there or like a
news ticker you could do whatever
um
in that slide over dock you can actually
pin it and it'll just like nudge your
whole ui over like 50 pixels or whatever
it is and it'll leave a permanent dock
of your whatever apps you want on the
side of the phone you can always launch
from there and it'll move like the top
three to be your most recent app so if
you're copying pasting between stuff
it'll just be like a click away at all
times
i think this is
a great idea that's a great feature who
hates the side dock in mac os
and has used plenty of samsung phones
and has never actually taken advantage
of the like you know scroll over side
apps i think this is awesome it's great
i think it's really cool i think it's
the perfect scenario for it and i think
samsung's been working for so long on
something similar like this it's finally
paying off in this scenario yeah i think
it's really cool that's a good little
feature you can also just unpin it
anytime you want yeah right like you you
can use it you can get tired of it you
can do you can do the stuff with phones
that's awesome where it's like i always
feel like with my phone
if i'm feeling like it i've had it for
too long i take the case off i'm like oh
this is a totally new phone now i can
just add a dock take a dock away oh my
god everything's different yeah i had a
time where i was i was using the s21
ultra for a little while and i started
using that slide over thing a little
more i was like oh i'll put my my to-do
list and my my camera and my like quick
access apps over there so i'll always
like have my swipe away but like my
muscle memory when i want to go to
another app is so fast to just go home
and just open it from the home screen
that i just didn't use it enough so the
fact that it'll always be pinned over
there
maybe that'll sort of
finally break
a new muscle memory habit we'll see
um but yeah i don't know for 1800 bucks
i'll ask this last thing about it do you
think
it
takes another step towards adoption by
like more reasonable people it's 1
800
and i was just talking also about like
what are the most premium phones you
could cross shop this with it's like the
most expensive iphone is like 1500 or
something right now s21 ultra is up
there approaching it but 1800 is still
above the top you got to really want a
full yeah are people uh still gonna keep
waiting you think
no
but we're gonna take a short break and
i'm gonna tell you about one that i do
think
is going to be a little more uh general
consumer all right i'll be right back

promo code waveform all right welcome
back uh before the ad break you were
asking me if i thought the folds three
was going to be like more general
consumer adopted i said no
the flip 3 on the other hand
feels to me right now not only is the
phone i'm a little more interested i
think i'm more interested because i
think more this feels like something
more general consumers will use fully
fully fully agree i haven't titled the
impressions video yet but i think it'll
have something to do with that oh little
sneak peek here on waveform and by sneak
peek i mean you're going to listen to
this like like two days after it's
posted but but we're still brainstorming
the titles just as we record this um
yeah okay so i had some hands-on time
with the flip 3. yeah i'll break it down
a little bit it's a thousand dollars
9.99 so now now you're really like in
the mix with other phones you can buy it
feels rough saying that in the mix but
it is in the mix we are not saying this
is cheap by any means no no it's in the
mix with the other very expensive phones
there are consumers that buy thousand
dollar phones who aren't big tech heads
yep exactly so what do you get so so the
last flip i i like the last flip there
were two of them actually there was the
z flip and then there's a z flip 5g
which is like the second one a little
bit of a newer chip
excuse me a little bit yeah um and we we
know people who like love the flip i'm
pretty sure austin evans still dailies
the flip today quinn used it a bunch
also my favorite is quinn used to just
like throw it on the ground every once
in a while it's like a daily phone just
like any other phone i love it um
the flip had a couple interesting
shortcomings because it was mostly
compared to the razer it had a very
small outside cover screen yeah i i
actually described it as like the better
hardware razor without the nostalgia so
ultimately that doesn't sell very great
yeah yeah it had it had like a one it
had a 1.1 inch outside cover screen so
it really just shows you the time you
could like swipe your call to accept on
and see stuff on the outside but it
wasn't great it was very small so that
was the one thing i really wanted to be
bigger it also had a 60h display
and it had a pretty high price tag so
again 9.99 this is a 128 gig phone so i
think the asterisk i'll put on this 9.99
price is
the other flips in the past started at a
higher price but they also started at
256
so the 256 of this year's phone will be
higher but they've cut down to 128 gig
for 9.99
most thousand dollar phones have more
than that but so they did and they
didn't yeah they got there but not quite
anyway so they have a bigger outside
cover screen and i i just generally like
this design way more we've been handling
the old flip just a billion times more i
can't even describe how much more i like
this than the old one that mirror finish
was terrible yeah that thing
it kind of looked like a toy to me quinn
austin if you're still holding the flip
rack doesn't mean it's not good i just
did not like it no you're gonna like
this one way more though yeah okay so
they flattened out the sides they've got
this little two-tone design but the
outside cover screen is now 1.9 inches
which is hard to you know put in context
but it's way bigger it's like four times
the area
um because it's twice the diagonal yeah
i mean
we basically say it looks very much like
a pixel 2.
if you imagine a pixel 2 that could fold
in half and then you take the glass area
on top of the two-tone you know exterior
yeah that's basically the screen yeah
right next to the dual cameras
so now that this outside screen is way
bigger you are more it's not like razor
big where you're like reading through
things on it but it is much bigger to
the point where you can like tr triage
notifications on it you can swipe over
and like do music playback controls
comfortably yeah and these are things
you don't want to have to like
it's this thing where you don't want to
open the phone every time like you put
out your pocket you just want to hit
pause having to open it unfold it and
pause is just one more step
so it's a the original flip it solved
the problem by being able to be more
compact but then also created a new
problem with that is like generating
that extra step in between doing things
so this solves the problem it created
yeah so it it takes away some of that
friction of getting the quick things i
think there's a stopwatch there's the
timer alarms you can put a weather
widget in there view your calendar just
like some neat simple quick glanceable
things makes sense do we know if you can
get into like google assistant or if it
just uses the phrase there now it's
closed so i didn't get to try during the
hands-on i don't believe there's a way
to get to the assistant on the outside
screen i could double check that when we
get the units yeah but i believe because
that would be really nice to not like
i think about all the times where i just
i still love my squeeze feature on my
pixel and just like being able to pull
up assistant on the outside screen
without opening it and get a quick
result on there would be awesome yeah
yeah that would be nice i i'll try that
for sure okay but yeah like you said it
looks like the pixel 2 because it's
two-tone
the hinge again gives it ipx8 so it is
not dust resistant but you can splash
this phone and it'll be fine
uh snapdragon triple eight eight gigs of
ram on every spec
and it's just it feels when i open this
phone there's like a there's one upside
and one downside to it when i'm when i'm
using it it feels the most like a
regular smartphone of any folding it
looks the most like when that is flipped
open it just looks like a
a weird aspect ratio regular flip or
sorry regular like candy bar smartphone
yeah and it's not even that crazy it's a
little tall but yeah it's pretty close
and the hinge is so good that when you
open it fully flat it's really flat and
you you kind of just ignore the crease
the downside is because the crease is
across the middle
a lot of your swiping touches the crease
which is not true about like the fold
because it's in the middle horizontally
so you do you feel the crease i think we
had this conversation yesterday and i
found it super interesting we didn't
bring it up last time or just didn't
notice it maybe but like yeah if you
have a
phone that folds
i'm just gonna call it hamburger style
and then a full phone that full hot dog
style like you are the creases
horizontal or vertical when it's
horizontal you're scrolling over all the
time because that's just where your hand
goes when it's in that big
uh big screen of the fold and it's in
the middle vertically you're almost
never scrolling over it because if
you're swiping left or right it's
probably on the left or right side of
the screen yeah you almost never drag
your finger over top of it yeah so i
feel like the the fold with its big
vertical crease is more visually
distracting
but the flip with its small horizontal
crease is almost never visually
distracting to me but i do feel it with
my thumb which is almost more
distracting it's a feeling you just have
to you kind of have to just hold it and
use it yeah it's a vibe you'll figure it
out once you hold it you'll understand
what i'm talking about
um
but yeah it's just it's much better
built it really is much better built
it's got the flat side it's still got
the fingerprint reader and the power
button like we said we like that ipx8 i
mentioned we like that not a whole lot
wrong it's got better speakers as well
it doesn't do s pen support despite the
stronger cover glass in this phone too
that doesn't bother me it doesn't bother
me it also doesn't have the fingerprint
or sorry it doesn't have the hole punch
selfie camera either it has a cutout
still on the inside it it does have a
whole bunch it doesn't have under sorry
yes that does happen we have so many
there's too many vocab words in the
smartphone world sorry if we messed one
up
in a while it does have the cutout and
i'm fine with that too it's the only
selfie camera although yeah you can
close the phone and use the the
outside's cover screen as a viewfinder
so if you want a good selfie there you
go that's so easy too to just pull out
that little thing just like in the palm
and just snap a photo nice that's what i
like about
so yeah it's the it's the closest to a
regular phone
in air quotes regular phone to me it's
the closest to a regular phone
experience closest to a regular phone
size closest to a regular phone price
uh closest yeah yeah but i think this is
the closest that we're gonna get to
regular people
picking up this phone and if i were to
recommend any folding phone to a real
human today this is definitely the one i
would pick to me it is the the
folding phone that gets the closest to
what it's like intended to be this is a
supposed to be a regular phone that then
becomes compact when you're storing it
it does that it does exactly that this
is so much easier to fit into a purse
into a bag into a pocket like it just it
can't it's much more compact while being
a regular phone when it's open the folds
kind of purpose is to
is it talking about almost becoming a
tablet it's not quite there yet it's
still a bit small and it's still really
chunky when it's folded in so i think
that's still a ways from hitting it's
like
exactly what it's intended to be whereas
the flip kind of nails it already the
fold has a bigger ambition exactly and
that's why i think it's going to take
longer yeah i totally agree with that i
think whenever i think about these
folding phones my question is always
why does it fold
and the answer for the flip why does it
fold is oh so it can be more compact in
your pocket oh that's simple great it
does that it wins
for the fold the reason why does it fold
is so you can have a tablet in your
pocket and that's a much bigger ambition
and they're working towards that right
now it's it's a seven and a half inch
screen it's not like
replacing an ipad but like an ipad mini
is 7.9 it's like almost there but that's
hard that's really hard really hard it's
hard to get it as thin as possible and
reasonable as a regular phone and
replacing a tablet in your pocket yeah
so yeah the flip is there on the
ambition and i think that's pretty cool
also
david pointed this out because he
thought it was great that there are
seven colors
put seven colors potentially eight
actually yeah potentially eight but uh
four regular colors three samsung.com
exclusive colors and then the tom brown
edition and then there's also two skus
there's 128 gig and a 256. so that means
uh
16 versions of this phone that not a lot
of people are gonna be buying but that's
that's samsung for you just making all
the things yeah if you're arguing um
folding phones aren't here to stay i
don't think anyone would make 16 sku
numbers on the phone they didn't think
was actually going to do something
samsung's gonna make sure they're here
to stay
um
i don't know i i'm into the uh the mat
the black one the phantom black one is
the only matte finish one that i saw
from those four colors so they were
cream which is like yellow
green which is a sort of a darker
military green type thing
lavender is purpley and then phantom
black matte black so two-tone would be
it would actually be two different
finishes glossy and matte black yeah i
mean very similar to pixel two black um
i really wanna see green in person
from the videos that i've seen cr cream
looks nice um it's like banana
oh is that the banana one yes baby
cream's not nice
green green looks the most interesting
to me i don't know i've been really
digging green phones lately i like that
they're doing them and i like that
they're not doing them bright they're
doing them like a muted color instead i
think when we got that it was with the
11 the iphone 11 with that i love it
love it love it i think that's one two
more muted stuff because then the 12
blue also looked amazing pacific blue
one of the best hot take
best iphone car of all time not a hot
day not a hot take no you're wrong if
you don't the best iphone color of all
time i think that's
it's debatable i mean there's some great
reds
there's some great reds yeah um but i
really like how dare you make a samsung
conversation and an iphone into an
iphone i just love you it's the natural
flow of tech conversations you know
that's kind of how it goes
um anyway that that's pretty much it
we've got a lot more obviously the
watches are out too
