hello hello welcome back to another
episode of the waveform podcast we're
your hosts i'm marquez and i'm andrew
and today we've got david and mel with
us as well for another special deep dive
episode i'm gonna say uh keep your
optimism hats on for this one but also
there's a lot of nerdy stuff and a lot
of space talk take it away david all
right
so you guys heard of the space race of
the 1960s well we're in 2021 and today
on the show we've got a new space race
for you a space race that you haven't
probably thought about before
stick with us
nasa's space shuttle program was a
shining new phase in america's journey
to the star kind of a curious mix of
science
business and self-aggrandizement for a
very small billionaire class in part
because as i said this is the first time
that we're going to see a launch from
american soil in almost 10 years time
five four
three
two
one
zero ignition
lift off so i'm about to bring you guys
into a deep rabbit hole of exploration
mind blowingness and uh space stuff as
we all
you know we all like space stuff i just
want to say space is like probably my
favorite category i don't get to talk
about yeah anytime we do space trivia
i'm all over it yeah anytime we get to
talk about space in any way all of my
like fourth fifth sixth grade like
reading way too much about space comes
up so i'm excited this will be
interesting because there's a lot of
space trivia in this let's see it all
right i'm ready okay all right well
first question i got for you guys uh do
you know what satellite internet is
just on a basic level yeah how does that
work um
well as far as i can tell there's a
bunch of satellites in space
and there's a bunch of data centers on
earth
and when people request information from
the internet
it pings one of the satellites that's
sort of geolocked over them right and
then it goes down to a data center and
then it goes up the sidelight goes back
to the person
like that assuming similar to like
satellite television
yeah uh data transfer through wireless
waves pinging off of satellites but
that's like the total basis of my
knowledge on that right right okay well
so as of as of 2018 um
how many people would you say
didn't have access to internet in the us
and globally
didn't have access to the and we're
saying like access in their homes right
like
general action yeah it doesn't count a
go to starbucks or something like that
yeah right most people have yeah most
people have access to internet you said
2018 yeah i would i would be estimating
90 of the us has access to the internet
i guess 80 has access
okay so as a 2018 about 14 million
people in the us didn't have internet
access at all okay and 25 million people
didn't have broadband access or faster
so that's like like
internet you need to do video calls you
know there's we've got a pandemic going
on the stuff you need to do
school with you know that's like a
pretty
sizable percentage i mean just because
you have broadband internet doesn't mean
it's great internet right either there's
some difference between like having
speed and consistency as well right it's
about four percent yeah okay so that's
just the u.s though yeah um
think about how much of the world
is online
yeah so it's a much bigger difference
around the world there's lots of areas
that are coming online now which is
really exciting
um
but yeah it's definitely probably like
60 percent of the world 70 of the world
has internet access
but it's it's not as good as certain
individual countries right you have a
guess andrew
you know i was very off for the us so i
feel like
uh 70 75
has access okay worldwide yeah you guys
you guys are close marcus got it
perfectly right actually immediately uh
about 40 of the planet isn't online yet
okay that's a lot of people yeah 40
of the entire planet uh more than three
billion people still don't have access
to internet three billion it's a lot of
people right
um and at this point like in 2021 the
internet's like become this essential
utility for
everything that we do like you think
about youtube you can learn anything you
can learn any skill you don't really
need to go to college anymore you can
kind of learn whatever trade you want
you know
um and even if you go into a store and
you want to apply for a job
most of them will say like oh apply
online apply online right you know it's
it's ridiculous it's crazy i was
thinking about sorry i'm interrupting
but the beginning of this pandemic where
i was like all right the whole world
around us is changing but what if you
just like emerged from your house with
no internet how long would it take you
to find other context clues to alert you
about what's happening right and there
was like road signs that said like
things about covey and there was like
people started wearing masks more in the
airport but
unless you looked it up
it would be hard to know it's kind of
like um it reminds me of this story
about war of the worlds there's this
thing that happened in new jersey
affiliated stations present orson welles
and the mercury theater on the air in
the war of the world by h.g west where
they were playing the war of the world's
radio show in new jersey but they had
like a public service announcement that
was going over that was like taking over
the broadcast
so it skipped the whole part of the
public service announcement where it
said by the way what you're about to
hear is not real yeah and they played
their all the worlds and there was a
total public freak yeah everyone was
everyone actually thought aliens were
invading so it's crazy it's like
everyone goes online now they say like
oh my gosh was that an earthquake you
know every little thing we instantly
have access to this internet so
wouldn't you agree that satellite
internet the idea that these satellites
can you know orbit the planet they can
kind of reach everywhere right there's
40 of the earth that's not online
and because satellites can orbit the
earth if you get enough of them you can
kind of get internet anywhere you on the
planet do you agree that that's a pretty
good thing overall
seems like a good idea
the way you're asking that's like a
shooter's life seems like how a podcast
would start
am i baiting you let's see i mean yeah
in terms of infrastructure and
everything that obviously would make the
most sense because you're not actually
establishing an in the ground
infrastructure yeah in hard to reach
places right and the world's been
changing people are working from home
there's nomadic and creative economy
lifestyles and like if people can kind
of just have the internet they can kind
of work from anywhere so it seems great
um have you heard of starlink before yes
yeah yeah i heard that sort of floated
around i think i know a couple of people
on twitter yeah whoever who have
starlink internet give a quick
explanation of what you believe it to be
um starlink is an elon musk company
and uh they're putting a bunch of
satellites in orbit and
giving people
starlink internet essentially and i
don't know if it's any better than
regular internet other than just being
accessible in more places but yeah
that's about all i know
yeah so so the
older satellite internet satellite
internet surprisingly has been around
for a very long time yeah i uh showed
you guys where i grew up yesterday the
middle of absolute nowhere smartville
california and
we had what was called hughes net at the
time and that was way back in like the
early 2000s right houston that's been
around since like 1996. satellite
internet's been like a an idea for a
while um but those satellites there were
very few of them and they were in what's
called geosynchronous orbit which means
that as the earth rotates the satellite
is at a position
uh in orbit where it's rotating with the
earth right right
so like that's good and bad it's good
because as long as you have a clear view
of the sky you can consistently get
internet right
but
when something is further away there is
this law called the inverse square law
and it kind of relates to both like
light and data transmission and all that
stuff basically the further something is
away
to an nth degree weaker the signal is so
if you're in geosynchronous orbit it's
higher up in orbit which means it stays
with the earth but the speeds you're
getting are not that great right you're
like getting pretty slow like it's not
even dsl
um and they have over the years like
companies like usenet have been able to
like get faster speeds but they're still
not that fast like they're still slower
than most data connections
so starlink
is kind of this
new company that like you said was
launched by elon musk that is trying to
make satellite internet much more
readily available and it's supposed to
be much much faster
he wants it to be able to be like you
can game on it
which means like you they want latency
that's like 1ms like 10ms is like what
they're aiming for right now with the
latency and then they want gigabit
internet off of satellites i want
gigabit internet it sounds great yeah
that
that's cool because yeah it's cool
because you have a little dish you can
carry it around with you anywhere
you could just be in your you know
camper van in the middle of the woods
and you could get gigabit internet and
it's kind of amazing right like sounds
like a great promise yeah yeah yeah
exactly it's one of those things where
like we have wired internet right now
and
everything you said doesn't happen like
yeah
the best i've ever had is fios like
800 or 900 down but even like
playing games like valor and pinging to
an east coast server we're on the east
coast it's like 20 to 30 right yeah and
like one ms is in
or it's sounds like 10 is what they're
aiming for even 10.
i don't think i've ever seen 10 ms ping
any game i've ever played in my life
yeah so so the project's actually been
around for a while i know you said you
only kind of recently heard of it it's
only because it's starting to just
recently start percolating and like get
online
it actually was uh announced in 2015 the
project's been in development for quite
a while but they only got the first two
beta tested satellites up in 2018. okay
so it hasn't really been in orbit for
that long um
and after they tested those satellites
they actually got
they were able to move more satellites
into even lower earth orbit so something
i should explain here is that the reason
starlink can be so fast is because they
are in a part of orbit called low earth
orbit which means they're much closer to
earth
but because they're much closer to earth
they move really fast they're not in the
orbit where they're turning with the
planet they're not rocketing across the
sky right okay so does that mean when
you're on the ground you're going to be
switching between satellites over and
over again yeah they kind of create this
big mesh network cool and when they work
always work yeah right
right
yeah um and when they launch them up
there they deploy like 60 at a time and
it's really interesting you can kind of
see these like these chains of starling
satellites that are just going across
the sky together
and it's really interesting but when you
have satellites that are shooting across
the sky that fast you have to put a lot
more of them up there because obviously
like you said you're going to lose
signal quickly and like yes because of
the inverse square law and because of
advancements in internet technology we
have like way faster internet from them
now
but you're going to
try to keep linking to new
locations constantly this is reminding
me very much of 5g
millimeter wave every time you hear
about these millimeter wave towers and
you walk by one on the street and you
get
one millisecond ping and a gigabit down
and then you keep walking you've got to
find the next one otherwise you're not
connected it is it is very similar to
that idea right yeah yeah yeah
oh
wow so those are that is one
constellation of starling satellites it
looks like have you ever played snake
dot io yeah yeah yeah it looks like that
you can just see them like stars movies
yeah yeah yeah yeah so this
this kind of like gets into this whole
thing right this is quite interesting i
mean for audio listeners it was
basically just
it looks like if just orion's belt was
even closer together times 20 and just
like moving across the sky yeah that's
fascinating so those were the first 60
that got deployed in may 2019 okay okay
so like they they send up this pod and
then as they get into orbit they just
start deploying
and all of a sudden you've got this
constellation and they're all kind of
linked together in the smash network
shooting down internet
game time
how many satellites would you guys say
we're in space right now
how many satellites are in space yeah
like wow space are orbit or just space
in general space most of them are in
space there's a lot of dead satellites
that are just like yeah just falling out
of orbit or just kind of you do know a
lot of fun facts about space yeah um if
i was guessing how many there are are we
assuming we're the only intelligent life
i think so i think that's fair because
it's not okay in earth orbit
currently in earth launched from or
earth
yes everything launches from earth yes i
think this is the lodge from mars i love
all the feathers i'm saying you know i
think there's probably um
400 satellites 400 in earth's orbit okay
any guess i make is just completely
blind
i'll
august 401
um how many would you say have ever been
launched in history altogether
satellites
oh
i guess i just assumed when they break
they just stay out in space and i was
counting them so that used to be how it
works okay they like come back they
can't even some can now fall yeah
let's go with 800 ever so 400 now 800
ever yeah okay it's probably like a like
one of these curves like this yeah like
for the last hundred years not very many
than a couple hundred years because we
didn't launch very much yeah and then
then we just started getting all of them
and now half of them are out of orbit
yeah that's my guess okay so
uh
12 020 have ever been launched
okay that's a lot more than 800. yeah
and that is that is like
that has been bolstered very recently i
will say that uh
7520
are still in space right now i was
closer
wow 7 000 okay and for about 4 500 are
active so almost half of those that are
in space are not doing anything right
now right
um and those are all numbers from august
21 2021 according to the european space
agency who kind of keeps date on this so
it's very very very active only a couple
months prior when i was doing this uh
initially it was only about 6 000 in
space as of like the beginning of the
year
so that's been a lot and if you
especially when you consider that 12 000
have only been ever launched and in only
a few months yeah 1 12 of that has been
accelerated right
all right you know where they're
launching from
i think like
cape canaveral or something
um yeah i'm not entirely sure
specifically where but i know that
they're usually around the equator
okay so wherever they do launch from
it's probably it just seems because you
said earlier six thousand now there's
seven so that means a thousand of them
have oh but it's like a positive since
january yeah it's not like each
individual launch
no each individual launch is about sixty
seven okay so they go up together wow um
still a lot of launches in a couple
months okay yeah so so starlink um
decent part of this uh how many
would you guys guess that starlink is
trying to launch right now as sort of
part of their little network
well like a golden
and like that they're going to like they
have authorization
i'm guessing they want it next year
like two years basically
they want to finish the job they want to
like cover the entire earth and
and have this whole thing available for
everyone on earth
i guess that's the goal right yeah cause
i mean it's they have to have sort of
this mesh network they're moving really
quickly right you know what would your
guess be maybe they want to double it
maybe they want seven thousand more
satellites i was gonna go like cover the
hours yeah yeah yeah that's a lot forty
two thousand satellites
whoa okay that's my satellite they have
authorization to launch not only that
they want to but they already have
authorization sheesh from the fcc
okay that's a lot that's a lot it's just
i'm still my eye keeps thinking about
that clip you just showed us of like
watching 60 in a row pass by you
in the night sky with your naked eye
just imagining the sky like looking like
it's moving all the time and then
getting like motion sick like looking up
the cars like
rotating around yeah yeah yeah it's a
little different right like stars um
that we see in the night sky
they they don't really they're moving
but not really but yeah we're kind of
moving around then it's a different way
um okay so yeah so the reason that we
found this topic at all title card um
is that uh adam actually sent me this
article
called spacex dark satellites are
still too bright for astronomers
um it was in scientific american
and i thought um this is interesting uh
the article basically says that yeah
starlink is very cool you know it's a
great idea
um but it's be creating a lot of issues
for astronomers they are reflecting
light
off of from like the sun
and it's kind of messing up things in
astronomy a lot of different types of
astronomy interesting yeah so there's
telescopes on earth that are trying to
look at things far far away
and these
these satellites are flying in between
the telescope and the thing they're
looking at and reflecting light back
into them that they don't need in their
data right so if you're generally if
you're doing like a long exposure photo
for example like all astronomers do
super long exposures they do up to like
two days right of exposures
and with the geosynchronous orbit
satellites they know exactly where they
are at all times they can just point the
satellite a different direction they're
able to do it they can avoid it and
there's not that many right because they
you don't need to have that many if
they're in geosynchronous orbit because
you always have a connection
with these they're just flying through
and you don't really know
where
the path of them is and when you can
avoid them and and the fact that like
you know right now there have only been
a couple thousand that have been
launched
and that's already creating a problem
yeah what happens when there are 42
000.
um
so at first these starling satellites
were like really really bright right
they were they were reflecting light
from the sun
and basically astronomers would like you
know they'd point their satellites at
them and they'd be like oh a star and
then they'd look they'd point their
telescope telescope yeah they'd be like
oh look a star and then they would see
oh that's oh that's a satellite that's
actually a satellite now it's moving too
fast yeah so both it was moving too fast
and then it was like it's just too
freaking bright
and um there's all these different
issues that it was creating because
these were reflecting so much light that
it could actually damage the telescope
because their sensors are really really
sensitive and light from stars are so
far away and because of that inverse
square law the light from a star
is like you're getting way less light
than it's actually emitting whereas the
satellite reflecting all that sunlight
beaming it's like when you take a
magnify magnifying glass on an ant right
you're kind of burning the sensor you
can actually break the sensor because
they're so bright
uh so that was kind of a major issue and
like
credit to starlink um they don't want to
necessarily just
they want to work with the astronomers
right um it's kind of this like 50 50
word thing where like yeah we're gonna
do this uh we got authorization and
we're just gonna do it we'll try to
mitigate the problems that we create but
we're still gonna do it i have a
question yeah about these astronomers
are these amateur astronomers are these
professional astronomers because when i
think of astronomers there's obviously
telescopes on earth huge observatories
that have to look through the atmosphere
but there's also
telescopes in orbit that i assume are
above a lot of these satellites and they
do that for an unobstructed view of the
atmosphere yeah how much of these
astronomers complaining are professional
astronomers versus
hobbyists in the backyard yeah both so a
lot of professional astronomers i'm
going to guess just because it's cameras
and long exposure that kind of when i
was first thinking of this i was
thinking of like oh someone looking with
their eye through a telescope and it
like reflecting light but if it sounds
like if it's destroying long exposure
like astrophotography not even
astrophotography like yeah it's like
astronomers deep space yeah yeah yeah no
it's it's both um
basically they do eventually a lot of
these astronomers that i talked to did
say that they eventually are going to
probably need to put satellites into
space
but right now uh one of the ones that
they've been working on for the last
basically since like 2008 it's called
the lsst it's in chile
and it's pretty much the biggest uh
telescope that has ever been created it
has the biggest sensor that has ever
been made it's like multiple gigapixels
uh and it takes like up to two minutes
or two day
photos basically these things and the
the point of this is to like explore
things like dark matter
and just like
different universes and galaxies and
just things that we've never seen before
and then i think we're going to borrow
it for a little bit and shoot a
smartphone review with it i think that's
the plan yeah yeah turn around point it
back across that'll be fun too yeah
that'd be cool
yeah yeah um and they basically said to
put a telescope like this into space
they're just way too big way too heavy
it's right now it's just too much to get
that into orbit they're so massive these
are huge telescopes
um so yeah so like sterling was you know
they were still trying to work with
astronomers because they they understood
that like yeah this is kind of a problem
we're still gonna do it but it's kind of
a problem so they worked with
astronomers to create these conferences
uh called satcon there's satcon1 satcon
2 that have happened so far
after satcon 1
they basically were like okay the
biggest issue right now is that these
are reflecting too much light
and there is different degrees of
brightness where it becomes not as much
of an issue for
the astronomers
so they tried different things they
painted the satellites black they placed
they're darker they're darker so they're
not reflecting as much light uh
starlink sends those up
they start
burning up and heating up like a
crapload because the temperature
difference um when the earth is facing
the sun versus when it's not facing sun
very big difference it gets really hot
and really cold in space yeah yeah so
that that became an issue it was
overheating all the sterling satellites
okay um now they actually do something
called visor sat uh which is actually
putting little basically putting
sunglasses on the satellites cool yeah
you know
which kind of like it darkens it for the
astronomers and then one other thing
that they do is um during the periods of
time when the astronomers need to be
seeing into space these satellites will
rotate their
solar cells to be a knife's edge versus
the earth that's cool so
now instead of blocking this amount
you're only blocking like this amount
right does that affect that the internet
that they're
no sending okay that's mostly that's
just for power okay so it's collecting
power while the astronomers sort of
don't need to use it okay yeah um but we
found this article really intriguing
because it was like it seemed like there
could be a lot more to this it was also
written a couple of years ago uh so i
really wanted to like
catch up with the update right because
things like the lsst the new
telescope in chile
it was actually supposed to go into
service like end of this year or next
year which is crazy because it's being
been being worked on since 2008. imagine
you get all of this funding it's the
biggest astronomical project of all time
and all of a sudden the entire
atmosphere just becomes littered yeah in
orbit with all these satellites wow it's
crazy right it's funny that like i'm
picturing uh if you zoom way out from
earth it's like oh earth these
earthlings want to connect with like
other like maybe intelligent
civilizations but they've surrounded
their own planet with too much space
junk to actually communicate or like see
anything
and that's kind of a bleak and that is
that is a concern that we'll get into
later um
adam uh so we called up emily who is the
person that emily zang she's the person
that wrote this article for scientific
american i'm emily zhang i recently
graduated from columbia university
i did some freelance science journalism
which is how this article came about
and i currently work for the veritasium
youtube channel
um so this article
i majored in astrophysics so my
background is in astronomy and naturally
one of the biggest conflicts or concerns
in the astronomical community
at the time that i wrote the article and
i would say today is satellite
constellations so she was an
astrophysicist and now she works for
very testing which is kind of amazing
kind of shows that like you can go to
school for anything and still be a
youtuber
the internet at the end of the day the
internet um yeah so
the biggest thing that she wanted to
really highlight to us when we called
her was that
this is kind of happening
with astronomers not really being able
to do anything about it right it's kind
of just like there's no laws really
about space
we just i think the main sentiment would
be powerlessness because i think these
astronomers
they're not saying like down with with
spacex and starlink and blue origin and
and project kuiper and all of these
forever
um i think we understand that
you know
there are multiple parties involved and
we're gonna have to compromise
but the main thing is that
i think we just astronomers haven't
really been able to do anything at all
um and so having to sit on the sidelines
while what you study and what your
expertise is in is is being dominated by
these other forces that are very new to
the game
is
uh
yeah i think it's it's difficult to just
have to be a bystander to that i would
say it's pretty concerning that
internationally and and even nationally
we're not seeing much discussion about
regulation about laws around this
there's this space treaty that was
written during
the space race but it was very vague it
was specifically written between nation
states so not about individual
corporations and companies and really
the main thing that it wanted to
highlight was not being able to use
space for like war purposes like there
were still ways there's loopholes that
were written in so that you probably
could use it for war purposes but the
idea was like you count you can't mount
a rocket launcher on the moon
you can't like
make a giant space laser that is mounted
somewhere but again this this space
treaty was written literally in the 60s
during the original space race uh the
world has changed a lot since then
clearly a little and i don't think it
took into account the fact that now
instead of there being a space race
between
individual countries it is now
billionaire corporations right there's
like even recently in the news it's been
the billionaire space race
what's being called the dawn of a new
space age billionaire richard branson
now though tomorrow another billionaire
is paying his way into space 71 year old
branson beating amazon founder jeff
bezos to space by just nine days we've
got jeff bezos versus elon musk versus
uh the virgin galactic guy
um yeah i don't know richard branson
richard branson
uh and all these people are just like
sending themselves into space they're
sending other people into space
and it's kind of just a flex
um
but the fact that it is now individuals
kind of makes this a lot more
complicated because at least the un can
kind of like make these treaties and
talk about who can do what but the
nature of capitalism
is to produce more and better than your
competition and when you have these
companies like amazon slash blue origin
you've got spacex you've got facebook
that are all wanting to get on top of
each other and just beat each other out
then then what do you do
so anyway but what emily was kind of
trying to say was that like this is all
happening right this is all
exponentially growing
and these astronomers don't really have
a big say in it yeah it makes me think
about like how how far above a country
is still the country i'm sure there's
some rule about this there is no rule
about this because obviously if you fly
over another you mean like you're a
certain airspace yeah that's that's one
thing but if you're at 40 000 feet or if
you're at 100 000 feet like where does
that end
so it's like there's not really a and
then the other thing is like the
satellites are just like
streaking right they're going so fast
that it's like they're in one country in
another country in another country the
issue is is we've got a similar
situation again like we have with
certain types of social media and so on
so forth where technology is advancing
faster than regulations could give up
that was jeremy he's an astrophysicist
we talked to in chile
sort of like facebook and twitter and
all these things we're just now trying
to figure out how do you regulate social
media and holy crap we're way past the
point where we should have regulated
this yeah exactly you know
um and so that's the thing about space
right now is like and so that got in my
head like
how how do you regulate this because
again like you said that's it's
something that's way up in
orbit it's not in a country
and then the other thing is there's not
a lot of incentive for individual
governments to necessarily
regulate it because like who regulates
it right and and also your like your
country's gdp
is determined by how much output it
makes and so if there are more companies
in your country that want to
create like get into this newfound
frontier that makes a lot of money
you don't really have any incentive to
say no
so you want to learn a little bit more
about how this is going to go what the
astronomers and astrophysicists think
about this how they feel about it
specifically what they said about like
moving at the pace of social media how
we could possibly regulate it who is
going to regulate it you know this is
like seems like un untouched territory
like nobody knows what to do
are we all on the same page that it
should be regulated like the obvious
path is that they're about to put 40 000
new satellites into orbit and it's gonna
really suck for astronomers on earth
which is most astronomers yeah something
should be done or they're just gonna do
it for everyone on earth if we don't
regulate it right at some point and
actually there was this uh tweet that i
saw that said once spacex gets 12 000 of
the 42 000 up and originally they had
only asked for 12 000 and it got
accepted and then it got accepted so
easily that very soon after they were
like can we put 30 000 more and the fcc
was like sure
and it was like what they didn't really
have any reason to say no yeah yes they
didn't think of any but is it going to
be bad for us on earth because now the
night sky looks
different or will we will we even be
able to see that multiple things there
was a tweet that i saw that uh that's
basically said once the 12 000 are up
the number of satellites that we will be
able to see will outnumber the amount of
stars we will be able to see
so the night sky will we'll we kind of
think they're just depending on where
they are
satellites
and to be fair the way that they are
visor setting these and all these things
uh a lot of times it can make it so it's
hard to see with your naked eye
especially during the day
um you'll most easily be able to see
them at don and dusk
and the fear is that the worst affected
science is actually some of the most
important that was jonathan mcdowell an
astrophysicist at harvard
it's the uh science where you're doing
wide area surveys
looking at a lot of sky
low near the horizon uh early in the
evening at twilight
which is where the satellites are
absolutely the worst
but that's where you have to look to
find the asteroid that's going to hit
the earth
and so that what we call planetary
defense
uh subset of astronomy is the one that's
potentially most threatened so
we might lose that kind of uh astronomy
which is not great
yeah so for context there are about the
upper estimates are about 10 000 visible
stars in the night sky
at night depending regardless of where
you are on earth oh yeah yeah so it'll
outnumber pretty easily and um you know
a lot of people said like you know you
won't be able to see them with your
naked eye but there's so many issues
because
not only
uh is it going to you know is it
emitting all this stuff
but also even if you turn the
wings so that their knife's edge towards
the earth the core part of the satellite
is still blocking a light signal from
coming through of a potential
you know a potential star that you're
trying to observe right you're trying to
observe the star
and you can just get these huge streaks
that just fly through your image when
you're using when you're doing long
exposure stuff right
yeah so this is when a single satellite
flies through hubble's field of view
wow it's just a big slash straight
through your image yep you know you're
getting this deep space image honestly
that'd probably make for a really good
youtube intro sequence
[Music]
hey what's up mkbhd here and bright
white streak through the sky yeah i mean
it's like it's crazy because there's so
many random elements of it that you can
tell are natural and then there's just
this perfectly straight line like
straight through the middle yeah
beautiful stars and then just straight
line and just like imagine that's like
one telescope
oh my gosh
that's one satellite yeah imagine what
happens when you've got potentially
hundreds or thousands that are coming in
and that's interesting because hubble is
one of the atmospheric telescopes it's
already orbiting earth but it's lower
orbit than a lot of these low orbit
earth satellites wow so this is even
messing with those even if you put uh
these telescopes into space
then you could still have satellites
coming through which is wild that's
brutal just wild wow yeah
um i love hubble i know hubble's so dope
and they're actually gonna replace
hubble pretty soon right um which is
cool as well
uh but yeah so she we wanted to learn
more about this uh so she had us call up
these two people this one guy named
jeremy tregolone reed
who is an astronomer in chile and an
astrophysicist named jonathan mcdowell
at harvard
so we first called up jeremy in chile um
and surprise surprise our call had a lot
of issues a lot of problems his internet
was not great
and we actually had to call him a second
time a couple weeks later because we
tried to salvage the call we had but
even during the call it was like i heard
every fifth word that he said and i
tried to make sense of what he was
saying and it just like didn't work well
and then the service that we use that
does the podcasting interviews just
couldn't upload his side we only got 15
minutes of raw data and it was just not
good sounds like we need starlight yeah
so that was that's that's the funny
thing is he was like
this is really affecting my work
but i could really use one of these star
links right now
it was just it was it was so ironic
um we asked him about that lsst
telescope
and
he just said like you know
yes i've seen it as things stand at this
precise moment in time yes i do see it
as being a
major development issue
this could be such a major issue because
they've been working on it since like
2008 and then all of a sudden there's
gonna be thousands just flying through
and the lsat the lsst works on more than
just optical stuff it also does radio um
telescope work radio astronomy
which starlink specifically is another
problem for because not only are you
blocking uh the light that's coming if
you're doing radio astronomy and you're
listening they're listening for
literally black holes right they're
listening for energy coming out of black
holes which is wild
and there's just these faint whispers
from you know wherever the heck and
they're in chile and there's no signal
coming through they're literally
listening for black holes yeah and then
you think about okay there's this
satellite that's whizzing by not only is
it
brighter than it should be
and it's blocking potential signals from
coming through it's also shooting down
gigabit internet
which is a radio signal puking in it all
over the telescope and and he was
telling me that these that whiz by they
could literally just make the your
entire image just white
and radio astronomy is a lot more
sensitive
some of these objects are thousands of
times brighter than the sun is to these
radio telescopes and the saturn calls
burn out of the equipment and you know
damage equipment which that costs money
to replace and loss of
you know observing time because you
integrate for the equipment to replace
some of the space telescopes we take a
two-day exposure uh and so because we're
looking for
ludicrously faint things
right and so you know go oh here's a
here's a light ray from that star
here's another light ray from this
right and and so it doesn't take so when
you have a
bloody bright satellite going overhead
it leaves a really bright trail on your
image that saturates the detector that's
trying to look for so much fainter stuff
they could literally just make the your
entire image just white yeah like it can
completely ruin the image and it could
also be one of the things that breaks
the telescope and
this telescope there's been millions and
millions of dollars invested into this
telescope and so the fact that they've
been working on this basically since
2008 it's supposed to be operational by
2023 it was supposed to be 2022 but then
coveted
and then out of nowhere cup like a
couple years before you open all of a
sudden the
orbit just starts being filled it's kind
of ridiculous like it's not really fair
right it's like building like a
beachfront property and then they by the
time you're done they build another
property right in front of the ocean
yeah yeah pretty much
pretty much you spend 10 years building
it and then all of a sudden the condo
goes up right yeah or something this

alright so we're back again we got two
independent recommendations for jonathan
mcdowell this astrophysicist at harvard
and uh he proceeded to sort of blow our
minds about like how ridiculous this is
all going
the the bottom line is there's nowhere
to hide
from these satellites right it's also a
problem for radio astronomy
uh uh we're in the we have these radio
telescopes in very
isolated regions where there's no radio
transmissions in the vicinity except for
satellites coming overhead
lots of radio track very bright radio
transmissions and even if they're in a
fairly narrow band mostly if one percent
leaks out into a slightly different
frequency we're trying to listen to
these incredibly faint whispers from
distant
you know creating black holes and and a
tiny amount of bleed off from this super
loud searchlight radio satellite uh is
just gonna swamp us what if orbit is
just totally filled with signals from
these satellites and we can't listen for
these whispers anymore we're basically
creating this kind of like
dome around the earth where we can't
listen outside of it right we can't look
for things outside of it we can't listen
for things outside of it and he is
convinced that there is going to be a
catastrophic failure event
before anything is actually done
about
this problem um have you guys heard of
uh
kessler syndrome before
kessler kessler syndrome i have not
heard can't say i have no okay
uh so in orbit things are really just
falling they're in free fall right
uh that's something i think a lot of
people don't actually realize
is that they're just far away from
enough from the earth so that they are
falling towards the earth but they're
also falling in a direction in a vector
away from the earth and they're at a
such uh direction
that they're just kind of like spinning
because it's just this combination of
downward force and then outward force
and it kind of creates this angled
vector
so when things are in free fall
they can fall really fast right
so kessler syndrome
is when you get something in orbit that
hits another thing in orbit
and then it creates shrapnel in orbit
and that creates more shrapnel and then
that hits more stuff which creates more
shrapnel this reminds me of a scene in
interstellar yeah i haven't seen that
movie i watched it like two weekends ago
but there is an explosion of one
satellite in space and some of the
shrapnel is heading towards some of the
astronauts because the thing exploded
and it's going everywhere and then
there's a part in the movie where all
the shrapnel arrives and it tears a hole
and the spaceship and the space station
has a hole in it now right yeah yeah i
mean so how how fast do you guys think
that things move oh they're going fast
when they're orbiting yeah i've seen
videos from the international space
station where that is also orbiting and
it's going like 20 25 000 miles an hour
like it's you they orbit the earth like
eight times in a day which is some
insane number
i have no idea what i assume two things
colliding at that speed is just
instant destruction of both those things
pretty much instantly yeah yeah yeah so
things are in free fall generally around
17 000 miles per hour
yeah there's um something happened to
the iss recently a few years ago where
like
it was like a piece of debris a paint
chip something
came off of a satellite
hit the iss it was so tiny it was like a
particle and it left a crater in the iss
like this big oh my goodness yeah like a
softball size
yeah that's crazy sorry to interrupt by
the way the movie you were thinking of
was crap gravity oh
yeah
and there was a scene where it destroyed
maybe it was gravity maybe it was did it
have sandra bullock
yeah so things are moving at 70 000
miles per hour basically it just causes
chain reactions right and
and so i'm starting to get nervous he's
telling me about this stuff and i'm like
okay um so you've got spacex and amazon
blue origin and facebook and boeing
these are all companies that are
confirmed to be putting satellites into
space right this is just the united
states um if spacex themselves starlink
is putting forward 2000 up amazon is
supposed to put a few thousand up
already they are confirmed to be doing
this facebook is
trying to put up a little mini
constellation facebook wow okay yeah
uh boeing and it's just like these are
just us companies again yeah and
they really have not a lot of incentive
to talk to each other besides like maybe
the fear of kessler syndrome happening
but there's this estimate by
that by like a couple years from now
there's going to be over a hundred
thousand satellites in space right
and yes orbit is very large and there's
a lot of room but yeah it's pretty big
but it's not infinite
you know and it's very to me it's very
similar to the oceans because
people thought the same thing in the
oceans is like they're really big we can
throw lots of crap in there forever and
it'll never make a difference
oops no it didn't quite it doesn't work
that way and and so uh
that's the same with space space is
famously big when you have a hundred
thousand satellites even one creating
shrapnel and you no longer have the
ability to control that shrapnel and
it's going everywhere you can't really
like if the chunks are big enough you
could probably track it but if they're
shrapnel which like you know of little
paint chip came off and damaged the iss
you can't really track that it's just
gonna go everywhere yeah is it no longer
uh are we just creating this sort of
like
radio bubble where we can't hear
anything outside of the earth
if you have a hundred thousand
satellites creating shrapnel you're
gonna create this dome of
seventeen thousand mile per hour
shrapnel around the earth
where you can no longer send anything
into space
do you remember that article this was
probably a few months ago where there
was a i think it was a chinese satellite
that had like lost communication or
power or something and was going to fall
out of orbit but we didn't know where
because it was not being communicated
yeah and it was it was sort of a
trending topic for a couple days where
we were like it's on the path of
this you can follow the path we just
don't know when it's going to land it
could land in the pacific ocean oh but
now it's over new mexico oh but now it's
over the atlantic ocean and just keeps
going and growing i feel like uh
maybe one of these events he's talking
about looks kind of like that where one
thing starts to fall out of orbit and as
soon as you can't communicate with it it
could hit another thing and then
then that's the chain reaction yeah and
it creates almost a uh what is that
there's this uh this is idea of creating
like a sphere around the earth that
creates this self-sustaining
biosphere by biosphere sort of we create
that but it's bad it's all shrapnel you
know and it's like it's like we're
saturn but except it's a sphere and it's
a moat but now you can't yeah
right yeah and so so like to be fair the
newer satellites have um avoidance
systems where they're able to sort of
like if they track something coming
towards them they they can avoid they
can dodge things they can dodge things
technology is crazy yeah yeah um there
was this event that happened where
the space force um now us phase four
yeah noticed that the
one of the starling satellites was
coming within
it
technically like
10 times the limit that it allows which
i think was still like
a couple kilometers it's still very
curious how close they actually get it
was it was a couple kilometers or a few
kilometers and they they were like it's
probably not gonna hit it but this is
still 10 times over our limit and so
they have propulsion systems in the
starlink satellites that allow them to
kind of move
but still
it's more of a communication thing right
because you get all of these companies
and so
i started thinking about
what happens when
every other country starts getting in
the game obviously china's competing
with us russia's competing with us india
is competing with us the uk
uh there's things this one internet
company called oneweb from the uk that's
also teamed up with india that's putting
stuff into space and
individual countries have even less
incentive to communicate with other
countries right
the only incentive that they really have
in this whole satellite space race is
it costs them money if their satellites
break by hitting other people's
satellites
which is crazy and again it's like the
fcc and the epa the environmental
protection agency
they're kind of pointing fingers at each
other as to like who should be
regulating this and so now the issue on
light pollution really is that nobody
seems to be
feeling responsible for it right that's
joseph kohler he's a space policy
strategist at aerospace.org if you if
you look at
um
some announcements from like the epa the
environmental protection agency
they have clearly stated that they feel
that by pollution you know from space on
the ground is in their job char of
responsibilities
however they also provided since
i think since 1986
for for many years they've provided the
fcc with a categorical exclusion right
basically telling them telling the fcc
okay you just go forward and provide
your spectrum licenses and we don't have
to look at those constellations from a
light pollution perspective it's very
weird it's like it's just uncharted
territory quite literally is it
littering if you put up a satellite it
falls down on the earth did you litter
do you get charged for littering i think
so i think there was actually a thing
that that happened where they said like
if your satellite crashes in another
country
the country is liable for any damages
that happens right i think the one that
did end up falling out of orbit
disintegrated before it hit anything
yeah so a lot of the spacex um
starling satellites are made now to burn
up uh in orbit but something else that
jonathan mcdowell told us was like okay
so these are made to be able to go out
of commission you can propulsion them
into low enough orbit so they ended up
just falling into the atmosphere and
disintegrating
but we also
don't know
what that much heavy metal is going to
do with to our atmosphere right like
we're already worried about putting too
much carbon in our atmosphere so that
got us really concerned especially for
the the multiple countries just not
wanting to communicate with each other
and like i said earlier
uh the more gdp that your country is
pumping out the better your country's
doing and a lot of countries are just
very happy to have the higher gdp
you know um and a lot of these countries
are wanted to be with the u.s too and
then there's individual companies within
those countries and it just kind of
creates this exponential thing because
it's like yes there's going to be a
hundred thousand launching from the us
in the next couple years
let's not even think about china and
russia and india and the uk like you
know it's ridiculous it doesn't sound
like there's a clear good solution no
like controlling space is probably the
biggest question mark like obviously we
we want to everyone wants to be the one
that controls space and i feel like i've
seen this meme on twitter of like you
should buy land on mars because
some somebody will buy it from you later
and you just who are you going to buy
the land from like who owns that land
now i don't know
there's a lot of questions about
ownership of that space right
i don't know if there's an answer to it
right just like vice president
vice president it's like just because
the us put a flag in the moon doesn't
mean we own them yeah like you know that
could be yeah it's just the moon yeah
yeah that that just all got me thinking
about regulation like how do we slow
this down how do we
make sure this is done safely like it's
just going to happen whether or not we
want it to which kind of sucks and the
us can't just say like
okay we're going to take control of this
but we already let starlink put 42 000
up we can't say no to amazon now we
can't say no to facebook now when we
already said yes i mean they could but
then it's
you know i don't know it seems they
should just set a
this is my complete amateurism talking
this is just at a hard limit
we will not allow
more than x satellites to orbit earth at
once
right
and i guess that's not a great answer
because that just makes it a race for
who can have all the fastest yeah but
like look if the us puts a limit and
says a hundred thousand
what happens when every other country is
like oh cool the u.s is self-limiting
themselves oh yeah
we're gonna play a million we have no
limits we're just gonna keep going
because the one that creates that
controls most of the network kind of is
the winner we've seen the same thing
with 5g you know with huawei and
qualcomm and everyone's trying to like
control the most broadband there's a lot
of parallels to 5g oh yeah yeah oh yeah
all these all these uh like it's an
infrastructure thing there's a lot of
unfounded concerns about 5g as well but
there are still very valid concerns
about like
you're gonna have to have a tower on
every block in all of the world that's
just too much
new metal like there's just too much
stuff to have around yeah um yeah yeah
it's interesting yeah it's it's and it's
all it all comes down to wavelengths
right it all comes down to basic physics
where the faster you can move your
wavelength the closer you have to be to
that wave
but yeah i mean jonathan was
he was convinced that we were eventually
going to have star wars because uh the
outer space treaty of 1967 says you
can't put weapons of mass destruction in
space
you can't station them in space
so actually if you read the treaty
carefully you can put like high
explosive
space fighters out there that's
completely consistent with the treaty
um there's nothing in the treaty that
says i can't come up to you in my x-wing
fighter and and uh
blow you out of the sky as long as i'm
not using weapons of mass destruction to
do it right you're not allowed to mount
anything
on any like
body in space but you can send like a
warhead through space if you wanted to
yeah so you could shoot it into orbit
and then have it land somewhere else
yeah interesting
so i wanted to like figure out how the
heck
do we start regulating this obviously a
lot of these astronomers have a very
kind of negative
very
doomsday-esque idea of what will happen
and the general sense that i got from
all of them
was kind of this just like
yeah
yeah we're screwed like the hobby yeah
this almost happy like depression like
is what i was getting um yeah so so
jonathan mcdowell it was funny he was
like
don't worry the united states will
absolutely use orbit for war and i was
like cool cool cool great cool cool fun
yeah great great great love it we should
make uh another one of those treaties
yeah i brought that up actually i said
do you think that there will be a new
space treaty that's going to be written
up there's been a lot of discussion
about that this the treaty is 50 years
old
and it's really showing its age it's all
written in terms of you know
the assumption is that all the
satellites are either soviet or american
right
right um and and space is a lot more
complicated now and so
those assumptions don't hold uh
and it's sort of being kind of
duct taped to keep working
uh
um but yeah there needs to be a new
outer space treaty i think and and the
question is how can we get one it's not
gonna be easy and he said honestly i
don't think it'll happen anytime soon
uh if it does it's gonna be after things
have gone bad
and again there's just kind of this so i
don't want to like you know this product
has to be
super downer but it seems like treaties
usually come after things are headed the
right yeah
that's what it seems like he's saying
yes nobody really listens and people are
screaming into the void until there's a
major problem yeah you know gotta get
everybody on the same page yeah wow so i
kind of i was wondering like there's got
to be somebody that is
that is trying to regulate this or
trying to create regulation for this
right like
this can't just be happening and and
nobody is working on some sort of
regulation because if i'm this freaked
out right now as an individual who just
called a few people on the phone
you know there's got to be other people
so i found this website uh it says
organization called aerospace.org
and they're this third party
organization that creates
kind of policy that they recommend to
people like nasa or governments
different governments
they try to you know figure they do
testing to figure out how much of a
problem these things in space are going
to be
and then they do math on them and say
like because of this data we say that
this should be the way that things
should be
um so a couple people that i talked to
about about that uh and mostly
i came away with them sort of
feeling like well
there's gonna be a monetary incentive
for these companies to make these things
safer mostly because of that kessler
syndrome thing
and also because people do
care to an extent
right still worried about the
communications issues and all of the
like telescope problems that you're
going to have when you have all of these
satellites going over the top but a lot
of these people were
kind of under the
assumption that it would regulate itself
in a way
which
i'm mixed i'm quite mixed on personally
um
they they kind of figured like because
if you create issues like satellites
running into each other there's going to
be such a monetary issue where you're
blowing up your own money and then
you're also going to probably have to
pay to clean up whatever happens
the other thing about
the financials is that
in theory with that much scale it gets
cheaper and cheaper to launch satellites
like we're supposed to have reusable
rockets and we're supposed to be able to
do this thing way more efficiently kind
of sounds like you know there's millions
of cars on the road and it's in
everyone's best interest not to crash
but if a couple crash like yeah they're
going to crash the numbers
but kessler syndrome doesn't happen on
earth you know
we've got gravity not
quite right right right but even even to
that same this just the idea of like
it's in everyone's best interest not to
ever crash into any other satellite
but there's going to be so many right
that comes up mathematically like it's
probably going to happen a couple times
hopefully
with the best of the tech available it
won't
spiral out and out of control yeah some
event but um
they're just gonna have to deal with the
financial repercussions yeah a couple of
those and that's something emily was
talking about was like it is a really
really expensive endeavor and one could
argue
very inefficient
um
and so because of that you know
the the dream for starlink i'm sure and
these other companies is they figure out
a way to make it cost effective and over
time you know the technology develops
further further it will get cheaper but
right now it's it's incredibly expensive
it still is
and what they're sending up right now is
costing them billions
it costs a crapload to launch these
satellites right now right it's so
expensive and starlink's goal is to
bring high-speed internet to everyone at
a very low cost right now the 500 dish
plus hundred dollars per month is not
exactly bringing not accessible to every
accessible internet to people who don't
have access currently yeah um jonathan
mcdowell said an interesting thing he
said i think it's a false choice i think
a lot of the reason that we don't have
sort of fiber and other
non-satellite-based internet in a lot of
places is regulatory and not technical
because yes 40 of the world doesn't have
internet right now but then can't we
just give them internet the way we've
always given everybody internet like
i can kind of see how that like there
are places where it's just hard to get
the infrastructure there but then at the
same time
can the like some of those places afford
like so yeah satellite stuff so if
they're charging like you said that kind
of money for it currently it's also i
think it's just a monetary problem it's
like it's not profitable to bring here
to these regions right now right and
until it is like
the satellite seemed like a good
thing but also
but that's also extremely expensive and
is that going to be profitable well they
just think that they can get enough up
they can make it cheap enough to launch
these into space and deploy enough of
them that it'll eventually be and the
cost has gone down for them
significantly even over the period of
time they put it up
but i think that's um everyone that i
asked like why wasn't this a thing
before right because hughes net like we
said was the thing before with the
geo um geocentric orbit geosynchronous
orbit yeah
there's only a couple companies that
were doing it back then which is weird
to me and like a lot of them have sort
of gotten out of style
and most of the people i've talked to
were like it's a it's a cost thing it
just like they realized it was not
really profitable but when you have a
billionaire
space race with a few companies that
have too much money and they don't know
what to do with it
that's when you start investing in the
things that are
inaccessible right now for ninety
percent of companies that you can
eventually become profitable right
they're the only ones that can do this
and this is the only time in history
where you have
this much money in the hands of these
few companies
so it just becomes this
thing
another woman that we talked to
named robin who was uh also part of that
aerospace.org website
she told us there's this
registration convention as well there
are a couple things that are already in
place that have been there for a really
long time so although the outer space
treaty is kind of the number one most
talked about space treaty there is
actually a couple others that were
negotiated in the in the 60s and 70s and
so one of them is the registration
convention and so that that one has a
lot of countries signed on including the
united states and that means that
countries will register their space
objects with the united nations and say
here's you know some basic features of
the satellite what it's doing where it's
going um you know whether or not that
treaty is fully implemented and whether
countries are being super timely on when
they send in their data and how much
data they send that's you know up for
debate um but they also have lots of
both governmental and non-governmental
organizations that track space objects
as well countries do need to register
satellites
with their like trajectory angle
direction that everybody is kind of
proposing it hasn't really happened yet
like a ledger yeah it's like a ledger
and actually a public legend like almost
like a whole equator yeah they they
wanted to create this
themselves and i think um jeremy was
working on something like this with
somebody else where they wanted to
create sort of like a public ledger
situation i don't know if it would run
on the blockchain
seems like it would be a good use of the
blockchain uh decentralized yeah log
i mean not that anybody would want to
incorrectly input their satellite's
direction
and velocity well it could be a
malicious thing i guess yeah and with
every system somebody wants to take
advantage of some evil doctor genius
could mess up the ledger and then create
kessler syndrome and destroy the planet
if they wanted to it's gonna be a movie
on the blockchain you can't do that yeah
so bitcoin um
so what's the ethereum of satellites
just kidding don't answer that um so i i
wanted to ask jonathan like what's the
worst case in the future here and what's
the best case that potentially happens
right
he says worst case nothing happens until
something there's some disaster and then
people go oh i suppose we should
actually fix this
and it's too little too late
but that's the way humans do things
depressing i know but but i i just
looking at the history of of all of
these issues it's hard to draw any other
conclusion
and so the best case scenario is you
have an international system in which we
keep track of and manage
space as a resource and make sure and
you know provide the opportunity for
companies to
do profitable things
but constrained by
uh
um
paying for the externalities right
paying for the ways in which these
satellites affect the environment and
constraining how many satellites you can
have without you know causing problems
and so i think we'll have we eventually
have to evolve towards the system of
that kind and the question is how long
does it take us to get there and how bad
does it get in the meantime yeah i feel
like i kind of have slight adjustments
to both of those yeah i'm not i'm not
the expert at all
but on the the first one which was
nothing happens until disaster yeah we
have this thing now where we like
name every disaster as it rolls through
the country and it's it doesn't really
seem to change anything so maybe it
would have to be like a super huge
disaster right but
the second part was um remind me the
second part again because the second
part was the best case scenarios where
we have an international system where we
manage like a blockchain yeah yeah
that's that kind of comes back to the
self-regulating thing again yeah if all
these countries or these companies are
following the regulation imposed by the
countries they're in yeah their gut
reaction is to get out of that country
and do that business somewhere else
without the regulation so they can do
what they really want to do right
i'm not the expert but that's just what
i read into when i hear
you know so we're going to set up
the best case for you has some worst
case implications yes it's kind of like
the ireland tax law thing yeah yeah yeah
yeah what's that that's like where a lot
of uh companies are actually
headquartered in ireland no like
federal attacks
yeah apple gets a lot of flack for this
all the time because they don't have to
like pay certain types of taxes because
they're technically headquartered in
ireland oh is that like libya or
something
it's just a small number of countries
that
have this particular rule where it's
like just like encouraging for oh yes
this is great for businesses but also
now
it's like a money shelter it's like
delaware like a lot of companies will do
that for delaware too because they
technically headquartered so i really
wanted to interrupt to save you guys
mentioned blockchain one more time i'm
turning this whole thing off
your mics are off now
this episode of waveform is brought to
you by storyblocks so you tell unique
stories every day but telling these
stories and honoring the things that
make them special that's hard to do when
you're pulling from libraries full of
homogeneous stereotypes basically you're
better than that and storyblocks is too
so storyblocks is an online
demand-driven library of over a million
royalty-free stock assets whether you
need 4k footage templates audio or
images storyblocks has you covered with
their flexible subscription plans that
fit every budget and yeah they've got a
lot to choose from but after realizing
only five percent of their library
represented people of color storyblocks
launched their initiative called restock
it's focused on adding diverse creators
to capture the authentic and layered
experiences of underrepresented
communities since launching restock over
20 of the library now represents people
of color which is awesome so you'll find
collections that focus on the layered
experiences of bipoc
lgbtqia plus and other underrepresented
communities black love queer joy and
other content can be scarce elsewhere
but not with story blocks so go check
out the collections and much more at
storyblocks.com
waveform that's s-t-o-r-y-b-l-o-c-k-s
dot-com
wait form so i guess i wanted to sort of
end this with like um a conversation uh
about do we think that this is worth it
um how do we think this is gonna go down
i asked a few people like what can
people do i wanted to figure out like
what can people do to
try to positively
you know make positive change right um
because these this is going to happen
whether or not we want it to
what can people do to really like make
this nice i mean i got a lot of
different answers somebody said like
go outside and enjoy the stars while you
can and i was just like geez
gosh
yes but also ouch yeah
i don't have an answer but i do have a
way of thinking about it which is
a lot of the stuff we do here is like
we're looking at products and like the
final product is it a good or a bad
final product and usually that's where
my analysis ends yeah but there are some
cases where the
background noise that goes into creating
the product is so strong that you have
to consider that too one of them that we
talked about briefly was 5g
like
i talk a lot about the final product of
millimeter wave 5g of like it doesn't
seem worth it you can't get your signal
everywhere like this is a difficult
thing
to build up quickly and it doesn't seem
like it holds signal around a corner
like that's the product analysis but
then the background analysis is like
all the infrastructure all the like
building you have to do and all the
regulation and like having this thing on
every street corner and this kind of
falls in the same vein it's like start
like
yeah i'd like to have gigabit everywhere
that sounds like a great product if it
works you mentioned you've never seen 10
millisecond ping on a game what if you
could everywhere that would be amazing
it's obviously very difficult but the
background noise to making that happen
is like
literally like
filling the atmosphere with tens of
thousands of satellites and possibly
never seeing the stars the same way
again that's that's like leaving the
orbit of the earth i'm still surprised
that yeah that too elon and starlink is
potentially doing something yeah
our atmosphere is so bad and is also
somebody who wants to colonize mars so
badly i mean ultimately that's after
something bad happens but it sounds like
if something bad happens it spirals and
it's also
his thinking could be very like
self-centric where he's not thinking
about the i mean he's that probably
thought about all of this i'm sure
but like just the exponential growth of
all the other companies plus all the
other countries with a bunch of
different companies within them versus
just starlink right because orbit's big
enough that you could send up 42 000 and
yes it would outnumber the amount of
visible stars but we can still at least
get stuff into space and all the
starlinks are one system they're all
talking to each other but once you get
satellites from other companies they're
not talking to each other it's yeah
there's some correlations with our i
mean yeah it's naive to think if you do
something like that it's not going other
people aren't going to want to do that
so like it's going to happen the nature
of capitalism is that there's going to
be more and everyone's going to try to
be doing better and more than yeah so
each other if he's the one that wants
exponential growth thing yeah he's the
one starting the ball rolling though and
starting that going so that's why it's
kind of weird to me that it's like a
weird game of space monopoly yeah
like if every if every car on the road
was made by the same car manufacturer
they could all talk to each other and
nobody would ever crash
yeah but that's a monopoly you can't
have that sort of lack of competition no
i'm just giving the one upside because
every company wants to be monopoly no no
yeah but yeah so now you look at like
okay if every satellite in space was
talking to each other that would be
pretty good right but that's kind of
impossible
the competition yeah that's required
here's a here's another image um from
2019 showing a bunch of starling
satellites flying through this giant
image screen yeah there's what there's
got to be like 10 to 15 lines just going
straight through that looks like if you
gave a four-year-old a crayon in a
construction site like you could paint
the wall as much as you want but it'll
never look as good as you want with that
four-year-old with crayon in there yeah
wow so and again this is from two years
ago and it's uh only a fraction of what
we're gonna have i i think like going
through this episode it sounds bad but
my outlook on all of this has
gotten grimmer and grimmer yeah the
minutes have gone by well there was one
guy we spoke to dr joseph kohler collar
i believe
and his outlook was more
positive towards regulation being coming
from the companies themselves space
companies are a different different type
of companies in the sense that it's very
very capital intensive
now that being said i think that gives
us some time from a regulatory
perspective
to to understand um
what the projections are what the
forecasts are what the type of satellite
or constellations those companies are
proposing to start working with those
companies recognizing that there is a
need
uh recognizing there is a common benefit
um but also recognizing there's common
risk and starting to work with those
companies and developing the right the
right rules of the world and the right
best practices
so he was kind of saying that because of
the monetary incentive that everyone has
and it's in every company's best
interest to not crash into another
company that the regulation is going to
come from the bottom up from the
companies into government how do you
guys feel about that i don't think it's
it's very optimistic it's super
especially early but it eventually
becomes a numbers game and we see every
company i mean every single company does
things that take losses at some point
and like that is something that's going
to happen and like how catastrophic is
that
to
to other things like as long as it's not
catastrophic to their business they
don't care yeah and i don't know if i
trust yeah for the rest of civilization
i was trying to draw an analogy of like
companies self-limiting themselves in
order to not crash into others but it's
just like i don't really see that in any
other industry
so yeah it would be very optimistic for
this to be the first industry where
companies are like you know what for the
better of the planet let's not do so
much yeah to go into zero regulations
and think that right like we have
companies that are going into
regulations and still like not sell
policing themselves so it's great with
draw
i know it's a very like sad
outlook but it's like if you don't do
something someone else will if it is
profitable and if it will get them ahead
of other people and that's just the way
the world operates and so i think that's
why a lot of these astronomers are just
they they're just convinced it's like
this is happening yeah i mean who could
like i can't even think of how to get
around it potentially yeah and start
regulations i know it's like it be
that's the thing is like the un vice
president
the un's the group that had the space
treaty but um
it wasn't every country that signed on
to it a lot of countries have signed on
but not ratified which apparently like
signing on is technically the equivalent
of ratifying but you didn't actually
sign the doc you didn't ratify the
documents you didn't have people saying
yeah we did i don't know it's confusing
um but that's the thing is like there's
no one like
president of the planet and without
that it's going to be really hard
planet president
you're on to something
yeah one that's what i'm suggesting yeah
clearly one big game of monopoly yeah
wow but on the flip side
everyone gets free internet how
important is that yeah i don't enjoy
that 10 million part in here were we
getting free and was it actually free
and there's nothing
yeah i was going to say like everyone
gets it
that is also the other thing there is
like yeah i guess it has to get cheap
enough but like uh at the time it gets
cheap enough to hit those places that
are really not able to get internet
right now is there a better solution to
get internet to them by then it just
feels like something that's super super
expensive which goal is to get something
super super cheap to people that can't
right quite afford it i mean elon's
willing to throw a lot of money at this
problem right yeah you know because he
will eventually profit a lot from it
um
also just a quick a couple quick uh fact
checks uh it was
the european space agency which had to
take evasive action to stop its
satellite from being hit with starlink
uh
there was a one in a thousand chance it
was going to get hit but that was ten
times over their threshold that they
were willing to cross okay
um
the average starling satellite is 573
pounds and about the size of a table
oh that's way smaller than i thought
well i don't know what a table what
table they're talking about that's the
thing i was doing 500 pounds is not very
it's smaller than that
sure yeah yeah it's like a motorcycle
yeah yeah
but but you know there's also 60
you know well yeah yes still i mean 16
we're talking about tens of thousands
potentially hundreds of thousands of
yeah i mean it's there's gonna be a lot
of traffic up there yeah uh and then of
course we we
shared that article around recently
about spacex doing like ads in space
with with satellites i don't really want
to think about that i don't see how
that's possible yeah i mean if they have
42 000 they might be able to take a few
of them and drink your old team
over the sky but anyway
that's quite dystopian it's that one
it's kind of like the qr codes
in china they put up with drones you
know flying qr codes anyway that's
pretty off topic uh
basically i want to just follow the
story as it as it happens in the next
couple years because it's going to
happen very quickly and the fact that
just a year or two ago we only had about
um six thousand or seven thousand
satellites in space and now there are
twelve thousand is just kind of like
well 12 000 have ever been launched
there's 7 000 now
and they're only like 5 000 a couple
years ago and it's just kind of like you
said that curve that exponential curve
it's just doing that and i'm
more companies like amazon and facebook
and and one web and all these companies
have started saying actually we're going
to put a constellation of space actually
we're going to do a constellation in
2019 amazon
said they were going to put 3236 in
space and that got delayed
and they're still on track to eventually
put them into space but now that
starlink is doing 42 000 i have feelings
that they're um trying to up that number
so so knowing everything that you guys
know now yeah i guess the final question
would be
is it worth it is it worth it to give
internet to everybody
for a low cost and potentially lose some
of our astronomy some of the night sky
as uh as someone in the very privileged
position of having access to internet
everywhere i go
i don't need more satellites
but that will not be everyone's position
and you have to think about the again
i'm mostly in the business of thinking
about the final product and how it
affects the person
and i think there's a lot of people who
would love the idea of wow i live in
you know where'd we just drive we had no
internet for like half of the trip we
just did for a thousand miles it'll be
really nice to just have internet all
the time up here in lake placid in the
forest when i go camping or something
and uh i think a lot of people would
probably say it's worth it and they
don't really care about the astronomy or
the meteors not being seen at dawn or
just getting hit by a giant
like all right that's the sacrifice
they're willing to make um but from
where i sit i think i'm good yeah
i think that's a good way of putting it
i i do like if our entire world
had high-speed internet i think we'd
function just as a society much better
because there's all these different
societies
remote islands and places that are just
like super remote that can't get it and
just like if places like that or you
know poorer countries that if they had
it it would benefit them immensely and
if it were just to take away the fact
that we can't take pictures in space um
then i yeah then i think it's for the
better but i think if we're doing this
ultimate
aspect of like potentially
stuff falling from the sky out of
nowhere or like limiting ourselves and
destroying our atmosphere like
it gets way tougher yeah to say that
marquez looks like he has i just had a
random like light bulb moment oh
airplane wi-fi does it get better with
starlight
probably
like screw the astronomers you know
put them up you'd probably get better
wi-fi on the airplane than you would on
earth because of that inverse square law
oh i'm in
you've swayed me sorry john you've
swayed me sorry mr mcdowell uh
no that's that's fascinating yeah i mean
um i guess one one kind of counterpoint
is
you know these areas that the 40 of the
world that doesn't have internet like
the the like
rapid
change of life and change of quality of
life and like movement from being like
third world to second world the first
world country
that you get from transfer of
information like
like from my from my like
classes in college just like
researching all the different
changes in the speed in which we
transfer information and how quickly
society
developed because of these like
exponentially faster ways of
transferring information like
information is everything it went from
you know stone tablets to horse and
buggy to the post to
email was the biggest freaking change in
the way that the the business and the
world operated yeah and then we have way
to ignore the printing press
yeah you know books forget about that
forgot about the book part yeah the
wheel the wheel but yeah it's just it's
it's just these these areas could go
from
being extremely remote to like
participating in the global economy yeah
and that's forty percent it's a very big
portion you know right now obviously
they can't afford it but um eventually
if it gets cheap enough that they can
like that could really change the way
the world works and i've definitely
heard from some people that say like
you know
can i say screw on a podcast
uh
screw trying to colonize mars we should
be taking care of our the planet we have
you know and uh you know i think there
are multiple sides to that obviously we
know that our planet is eventually going
to become uninhabitable but that's my
favorite neil degrasse tyson anecdote
yeah when he's like all right
so i heard that in order to populate
mars you first need to
terraform it so you drop nukes on the
poles
and you've like you know you re you
restructure the whole planet in the
atmosphere and everything
and that's going to take billions of
dollars in like all these years
but we also already have earth and
that's in pretty good shape we could
probably do a little bit better and a
little bit cheaper if we just fix up the
one we have here yeah right um
i feel like i'm on that team yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah so that's what a lot
of people have been saying too and it's
like if we could just really get
everyone on the same page and really
equalize the playing field for the
entire world like that would be pretty
amazing as well and this is the fastest
possible way that that's going to happen
honestly like because there's not going
to be it's it's like the rest of the
world is speeding up exponentially well
no one has even able to
get the internet the long tail yeah and
we're going to be over here by the time
they even get the internet and it's just
kind of unfair and this is the way that
this could happen really quickly so it's
you know there are positives and
negatives
negative big negative is when you go to
lake placid to go camping uh you're
going to be camping under the
satellites instead of stars yes
there'll be waterfalls and babbling
brooks and lots of shooting stars all
the time shooting satellites yeah yeah
okay yeah
so that's the future we're possibly
looking at sorry to bum you guys out
today this is a fun episode it's funny i
feel like the uh the boosted episode was
it was a story but it was kind of like a
sad ending because the company died so
we're on two two sad endings in a row
i don't want to pressure you into a
happy ending for the next one but let's
let's uh i'll try to figure it out try
to find like a happy story you know in
the meantime let us know what you think
in the comments because i feel like
there's going to be plenty of different
opinions and different thoughts about
this and also our resident armchair
astronomers will be coming out i'm sure
you have lots of i mean you were a
resident armchair astronomers today yeah
yeah i put on my astronomer hat a little
bit there but we'll have them in the
comments section below so we'll check
those out too in any case this has been
