what is good everybody welcome back to
another episode of the waveform podcast
we're your hosts
i'm marquez and i'm andrew and today
we've got a couple
moves and shakeups in the ev industry
that i really want to talk about
we also have a new nintendo switch and
we're also going to talk about
ipad os 15 but first andrew's back
welcome bam i feel like i should be
ripping my face off to show david's face
trademark intro is pretty impressive uh
he he likes to appear
for his intro on the podcast but we got
andrew back
what was that what was your last week
like i saw some crazy pictures you took
i probably had like one of the crazier
weeks of my life last week
because i i started off by friday we
closed on a house
which is my first time buying a house
which is like thank you thank you
crazy and then before even getting to
move in i we immediately
left the next morning for yosemite which
was
i don't think i can even like start to
explain how
beautiful it was it was the craziest
park i've ever been to just these like
sheer granite walls that pop out of
nowhere yeah
altitude we hiked 66 miles in six days
so averaged
over 10 a day i was exhausted
um yeah it was it was amazing but like
if i want to tie some tech into here
of course i did something that yeah how
did you bring tech to yosemite national
park
um so i've talked previously about
bringing different cameras to parks and
what i think is the best
i think i've kind of landed on like the
a 6300 body being that perfect
like size for and like form factor of
bringing with you on long hikes while
still taking like super high quality
photos
um i i think a phone is probably almost
your next best bet and they were
uh i'll explain in a second but i
brought this time the fuji
x100 mark v i believe it was
um never used fuji before it's very new
to me
david and brandon taught me a few things
before going out like color profiles and
i was messing around with them and it
took some
crazy photos like really really good
photos i posted them on twitter
um i do have to say though as much fun
as it was what's cool is it's
you know fixed lens i don't have to
bring lenses with me like those
like really add up we were it was about
100 degrees out there so i was bringing
had a three liter bladder of water and
two water bottles and i was finishing
that every day
yeah um so having that little nice light
camera was really nice
and like i said it took great pictures
fixed lens no lenses awesome
my biggest issue with it was someone
else in our group
had an a6300 and every time i grabbed
their camera to take pictures of them
the autofocus was just so nice and
easy and simple and just nailed
literally everything and then i would go
back to the fuji and yeah the fuji
autofocus is not
as fast it's not made to be fast so yeah
interesting
i think my biggest issue with it was i
really enjoyed
looking through the viewfinder because
of how bright it was and
i would tap to focus on the screen in
the area i knew i was about to frame
where i wanted focus
and when i lift it up to my eye either
my like cheek or my nose would touch the
screen and throw the auto focus on
something else
and every time i would pick it up it
would just like
be looking like the top right corner or
something like that for focus so
i was trying to mess around with a
couple different of the autofocus
settings and nothing ever
quite nailed what i wanted i'm sure a
lot of people will be really upset that
i'm like using autofocus but yeah you're
gonna say it's
you know you're taking a lot of pictures
of rocks and trees and stuff that's not
moving around too fast it's not moving
but my thing is is like
because the park is so big it's really
hard to get scale so the majority of
pictures i thought looked really good
had people in them so i was
trying to catch a lot of candid photos
so it was
like we were moving pretty fast because
you were out for six or seven hours at a
time and you just want to like
pull it up snap the photo and just get
it so yeah
so i missed the sony having the like one
by one comparison switching to the other
one
yeah made me just really really
appreciate it and made me i think
solidify
my favorite hiking camera is like a six
the 6000 series yeah
i went on i probably told this before
but i went on a hike once with the
hasselblad
x1d and the 45. and it's like it is
their
smallest mirrorless camera but it's a
hasselblad so it was just big
clunky weight and the slowest possible
focus and i'm like i'm trying to just
take a quick picture and then move on
with the hike but like
it's not a quick camera so i would not
recommend
anywhere near that camera for a hike
yeah it's not i'll always remember
i took a video of you once trying to get
a picture of a bee up on the roof with
the hasselblad
when we first got it it was not easy
also because the plane of focus
is like oh my goodness oh yeah the
diameter of a bee it's pretty tough yeah
and you're like
when you're doing the really really
shallow depth of field and you're like
if you're out on a hike and it's bright
it's hard to see the screen you're like
oh nailed that and then you get back in
and if you miss your that photos sucks
you gotta go back out eight miles and
we gotta go backpacking tomorrow man so
yeah it was it was a ton of fun but i'm
also glad to be back
yeah glad to have you back thank you
okay nintendo switch
oled edition or whatever they're calling
it new product is out
um it's it seems like actually a pretty
nice upgrade i just i'm not a switch
user i've used the playstations and the
xboxes i've used my computers
my mobile devices for gaming not a big
switch gamer
can you tell me if these upgrades for
the switch
are actually worth what looks like a
what is it a 50
increase in price i think it is yeah how
does it look
okay i will say it looks like it is
worth the price
but not worth the upgrade if that makes
sense so if you already have a switch
you probably you shouldn't get this okay
i wouldn't or i personally wouldn't i
don't think the upgrade is enough
so here's the thing it's an oled screen
it's a little bigger it goes from 6.2 to
7 inches
the thing is is it's still 720 when
you're using it
and although you get a new dock it's
still only 1080
when you put it onto your tv so i think
i have seen a lot of rumors about a
switch pro
or something like that which if you're
gonna name something pro obviously
you're not doing professional gaming on
a nintendo switch
but the word pro uh sort of implies a
couple things
like probably 4k output from the dock
and maybe higher than a 720p
screen you'd want at least
1080 maybe high refresh or something uh
but it seems like the switch audience
really doesn't care about that type of
stuff
switch it switch is definitely
interesting because most of nintendo
games are like
super cartoony and it doesn't really
matter as much but i don't think
anyone would complain if they still had
4k mario kart
or 4k mario party or anything like that
um i know i would be amped about it and
there were rumors saying that they were
gonna
use some new nvidia chip i believe that
would have
4k output through the dock um but that
this is not it so that makes me
think first of all switch oled is like
the dumbest name
yeah that's that's as far as we know at
least um but
that just feels kind of weird they had
to switch light
which is at 199 the regular switch is at
299. this is at 350 so i do think
paying an extra 50 bucks for a slightly
bigger screen
oled obviously has its advantages like
it's still going to look nicer despite
still being 720
um and then the dock is a little
different there's a white
version it has ethernet on it which i
think is huge because before you had to
use an
adapter and just said usb you're right
yeah yeah um
which that's annoying like most people
probably use their switch on wi-fi which
if you're downloading a huge game that
takes
forever potentially um and it has like
some small things like they said
improved audio for tabletop stuff it
seems like they're trying they're
definitely trying to say like this new
oled screen is better for
the people who use it on the tabletop
i've never been one of those people it's
just
it seems just like a little nicer switch
yeah it's a little bit of a nice
50 bucks more that's not bad it makes
you don't have one already
right um i kind of think the coolest
thing about this
potentially we haven't seen it yet is
the switch price might go down
which would be awesome imagine a switch
at 250.
um i think what works great about that
is to me
the switch is like a secondary gaming
console i think if you are a
if you're strictly into consoles
playstation xbox are the way to go
if you are like me i'm a pc gamer and to
me the switch is like
i have friends over or i just want to
lay down on the couch quickly but i
don't want to spend
playstation money right so like a lot of
nintendo's games are much more casual
i can sit down i can play mario kart i
don't have to get super into it and slam
my keyboard and controller or anything
like that
like that's why it's great to me a
secondary console and as a secondary
console cheaper price is always better
and i don't care if it has 4k then
exactly yeah the most the most fun i've
ever had with a switch was
also the most the same place that i've
had the most fun with an ipad which is
on a plane
oh yeah or like in the back of a car
like in in some sort of transport
situation where you have a
very small space then like a switch is
nice because it's a small
like it doesn't take up too much your
lap same deal with like a smaller ipad
even like a bigger ipad it's kind of
nice so uh
yeah you know obviously an ipad is much
more expensive so you get
a couple games you like and the switch
can be a much better bargain
than buying an ipad and getting some
games for it so and the other huge thing
about switch is like what makes it the
most fun
is the multiplayer aspect of it and a
lot of that has to do with if other
people have switches so like especially
with tabletop stuff they do a lot of
different features where if you have
multiple switches folded out on a table
they can connect to each other and you
can play different games
so putting that at a lower price just
makes that way more accessible and able
to use those features
way more often so i i mean i know this
was a storyline about the oled switch
but i feel like it
if the switch price goes down that's the
biggest story here yeah i have a hot
take
yeah every company is pretty bad in some
way with naming
and nintendo just proved it with this
one yeah it's a rough one
so first of all this is called the
nintendo switch oled
which by itself is like not the worst
you get what nintendo switch is
this is the oled version of it really
it's just like a bigger nicer screen
with some extra features
but remember when the switch light came
out and it doesn't you can't take the
joy content off
which means it doesn't strictly portable
it doesn't switch
into anything oh it's not the whole
point of never quit
right it's a switch the whole point of
switch was like i can take it off the
dock and play handheld or
i can switch it into the dock take the
joy cons off and play it on a tv
that's what a switch is and this switch
light didn't let you do that at all so
it didn't
really let you switch and they just kept
the same name
i'm so embarrassed that that i've never
i'm just together
yeah every every company has something
dumb like this
every company no exceptions that's my
hot take here's uh
my here's my suggestion for what they
should have called this
i just thought of this okay although for
one reason it doesn't work is because
you can also get the new dock in white
so this doesn't help with me but switch
black switch
i was gonna say switch plus but why
black okay
so it's just a small naming change it
doesn't really imply that much has
changed
but what's the biggest benefit of oled
black blacks
yeah it's a bigger screen it's a it's
just a little bit more
i feel like everyone gets what plus is
and that's why i would have said plus
like i think people might care about the
bigger screen more than the fact that
it's oled i mean
the lcd is not that great what i also
haven't confirmed yet is if
it does say it does work with other
switch accessories like joycon but i
can't tell if the footprint's any
different
because the screen is bigger i don't
know if it just means the bezels are
smaller and therefore it's the same
exact footprint i
don't think so yeah um okay but you
might have to use the new dock for it it
comes to the dock anyways so i don't see
why that would make any difference um
yeah yeah switch plus there's my i still
switch black i was pretty proud of that
i'm kind of excited
i think yeah um all right speaking of
weirdly named products the tycan turbo
which doesn't have any turbos that's a
good segway market that was pretty sad
i'll give you that thank you
uh so porsche recalled tycans over a
sudden power loss problem this is a
headline i just saw
this past week uh with porsche recalling
it's eevee with a small number of cars
reporting a power loss problem which
is obviously a big problem and also the
audi e-tron
gt which is built on the same
architecture also had a small number of
those problems so they're also
going to be recalling um but yeah the
the article just kind of reads like
there's a small number of issues and
drivers reported this
problem for a long time and they've been
aware of it and trying to fix it and now
you can bring it in to a porsche
dealership and they will have to do a 16
to 90 minute software update to fix
this thing and give your car back uh
so essentially what's happening is the
um there's a
smaller 12-volt battery in there that's
specifically made to
keep everything keep parts of the car on
when the car is turned off
yeah that sounds kind of weird all the
accessories and stuff yeah and
the huge battery pack of the car drives
the car there's a much smaller battery
like every car has a small battery
to run the instrument cluster and the
always on the internet connection yeah
exactly and make sure like you know
you're you can unlock your car when it's
turned off or else you'd never be able
to get in and
what was happening was if that battery
died at any point some so i guess if it
got low enough and then you started
driving and it died while you were
driving it which
in some cases shut off the larger
battery pack wow so you're just
now you just had nothing and i mean this
sounds not that different from like
do you remember when you had you had
steering issues but that's still
something powering off while you're
driving and
yeah anything powering off while you're
driving is terrific it's not great um
yeah i've had power steering
i once knocked my keys in my car going
down a hill and
and turned the car off and lost power
steering and like
had to go down a hill without it and it
was terrifying yeah
yeah you never want that especially when
it's an easily fixable bug so i'm glad
they're fixing it
uh it says porsche sold around 43 000
ticans which is maybe the most
interesting i
think i learned from this article
because i'm trying to think about all
the scale and size of all these
different competitors and evs
um and they claim it only affects a very
small number of users and i
i believe that because this is the first
time i'm hearing about it yeah um
yeah new newer cars being manufactured
we'll have the software update already
yeah i won't have the problem
i always think like what if this issue
had happened to a different company like
if you reframe this headline
uh insert company here is recalling
their car over a sudden power loss
problem
obviously if you replace tesla with that
it's a huge headline
what if you replace like ford and some
random like
hundred thousand dollar ford what is it
what are you saying an ev one or like
any any any random ford car like does
anybody even care
does it even make headlines at all do
you know what's happening is like right
now
evie is clearly the thing i do remember
a long time do you remember
man this was very i remember doing a
current event in like fifth grade about
this
do you remember firestone tires having a
huge issue
like i fee i do feel like at certain
points when there are
things that affect driving which is like
as safe as it is is also something
that's always kind of skirting the line
of death
which is kind of terrifying but like
when anything happens when things are
drivers it generally makes some headline
i think eevee though definitely will
always be the bigger headline these days
because it's more new
it's more i hate to say it but there's
clearly more like fear-mongering
based on it because people don't want to
switch tv yet yeah it has the most
skepticism too
right like people don't know about evs
in a lot of places so when
they're looking into or learning about
evs they're trying to figure out okay
well
seems like there's these pros what are
the cons what's the catch like let me
figure out what evs are all about
so headlines about the most popular evs
are the most popular headlines yeah uh
happens all the time i think
like you said with porsche right now
people who are buying take-ins
probably have hopefully decent income
and they're kind of like they're willing
to take that step
into eevee a little more whereas if this
sort of happens at f-150 right out the
gate
i think it would be very detrimental to
a lot of people switching to ebay
talking about the lightning yeah
yeah definitely i see that affecting
more people
that's one where like i i
shouldn't give any company benefit of
the doubt in anything i should always
just use it and review it
but i feel like the f-150 lightning
is maybe the best example of an ev that
a company
can't afford to screw up oh for sure i
mean like they're aware of that
they've told us that forward and we'll
talk more about like transitioning to
evs as companies later but
ford really wants to make a great
electric
f-150 because they've attached the name
to it
because they've attached this heritage
to it and they're they're
banking on people buying it and
switching and starting this thing where
they can eventually sell more and more
electric cars and be the company that
successfully transitions
uh so their first one having any sort of
issues they're gonna be
doubling down right they're gonna be on
top of it they're gonna make sure
um that they don't have any of these
problems so
you know i hope to see it turn out that
way i hope they don't have any problems
but
yeah as far as giving benefit of the
doubt i feel like that's one where we
really
expect to see ford go all out so that's
i'm looking forward to that for sure
uh all right let's take a quick break we
got to come back and talk about
canada banning gas cars
this episode of waveform is brought to
you by mini cooper se
so you may or may not know since i try
to be subtle about it but i do
enjoy electric cars i've talked about
them a bit so the mini cooper se
is charged for the city and ready to
spark up your drive so we've spoken
about the usefulness of evs compared to
others on the podcast before and i think
this is one that actually takes the cake
it's a zippy car
designed to be as stylish as the city
you drive in unlike other evs the mini
cooper sc
doesn't look like it's out of a sci-fi
movie it still maintains its classic
design and won't look out of place
driving through the streets in new york
so driving the mini cooper sc was
surprisingly comfortable
it's a mini but it handles like a mini
it's like a little go-kart
and yet i was surprised andrew and i
both could fit in the front seats
no problem like pretty comfortably
actually like we're
we are not sure we i'm like
i'm out of frame right now we this
not every car not every car so that was
good to see
um get up to an 80 charge in just 35
minutes with fast charging at level 3 dc
charging stations or just charge
overnight at your home with basic ac
charging as well
plus the electric digital instrument
cluster inside puts all the important
things right at your fingertips
it's a unique looking circular
touchscreen display that makes listening
to your favorite music or podcasts in
the morning commute
as simple as can be plus the light
around the screen i thought that was
pretty cool it moves with the dials as
you turn them
to adjust the volume or to adjust your
ac speed that was pretty cool
and i have to say it was pretty
refreshing having actual knobs
to adjust some settings they're nice too
yeah little metal knobs which is cool so
if you're in the market for a compact
stylish quick little car to get around
the city then it's worth checking out
the mini cooper se
to see if it's right for you all right
welcome back
we got to talk about this new headline
there is a lot actually to unpack
in this one very dense headline so i'm
going to just read the headline
and then we can break it down yeah so
here's the headline canada to ban
sale of new fuel-powered cars and light
trucks
from 2035. okay
so canada's putting their foot down
they're saying no more gas cars and
light truck sales
in canada starting in 2035 so that's
what 14 years from now
yeah it's not that far away so there's a
lot
there's a lot there's a lot here um
let's start with
canada for sure shout out to canada lots
of great canadian friends
on the internet um yeah there's not a
lot there's not a lot of countries that
will just
outright ban something as a whole like
that but canada is one of them and
they'll do that i feel like they're
neighbors down here in the u.s it would
never
happen that way but there's lots of lots
of companies you will see
building up to committing to evs exactly
like
ford or audi or whoever will say we're
going to offer
a bunch of evs by this date and it's
kind of just
up to how committed they want to be or
how far they think they can get
um so canada's just straight up saying
like as a
committing to the environment like we
will not have any more sales of of gas
cars
so that brings us to the second thing
banning sales
yes because we have to double check on
this they're not banning the manufacture
of certain things you're still allowed
to uh manufacture gas cars
anywhere you'll still be allowed to have
all the same economics but
starting when this takes place in 2035
um
you will not be able to buy a new gas
car
or light truck in 2035. so that's one
thing
even there i'm trying to figure out i
didn't see it in the article but
i'm assuming it's new i'm assuming yes
they're not going to destroy
new oh it does say okay yeah so you will
you will i guess be able to buy
a used gas car because it was already
made you can buy someone else's car from
someone
but as far as manufacturers that are
selling their new cars in canada
if they want to sell any car in canada
it cannot be fuel powered
yeah that's basically has zero emissions
yeah so if you're a toyota
and you want to ship cars over to north
america you better have an electric
version to sell to canada otherwise
you're not selling any
to any canadians yeah basically guess
the only other
there's like is hydrogen powered still
like really a thing we haven't
uh it just has to have zero emissions
like sure we're going to say eevee for
the rest of this because that's what we
assume
there could be some crazy new ideas
you never know but it just has to be
zero emissions for the sake of
clearly protecting climate change that's
safe okay
then the next is actually kind of key
cars and light trucks and i think that's
that's
something to take note of because i i
had to look up the definition of light
trucks and that includes like obviously
the f-150s of the world but also like
lots of other trucks people use for work
yeah that loops those in too so it's not
just recreational cars people are buying
it's also
when people are forced to upgrade their
fleets of trucks
for their light duty you know
construction or whatever jobs there are
going to have to start to buy electric
versions by 2035 so that loops in
light trucks as well i wonder how
intense that gets because like
my guess so the first thing i think of
when i think light truck i think of a
truck that doesn't have to tow
pretty much um and and like i totally
get that because i don't think we're at
the
mileage in evs or you know maybe we will
be in 14 years but it's hard to make
that pledge now
towing is the big thing that i do think
probably gas cars are benefiting in now
because when you have to tow
things at a certain time in a certain
time period like that charging does
actually add up
so i'm assuming that's why it says light
trucks i don't know where that
lands in the fleet section though how
many loopholes there will be of people
being like
you know yeah i just have a smaller
f-150 but i tow stuff so i need a
gas-powered
so i feel like that brings me to the
last part of the headline which is 2035.
yeah there will be different leadership
probably by 2035. there will be lots of
advancements in tech by 2035 there will
just be a different landscape
in canada and its surrounding neighbors
by 2035. for sure
so it's sort of this like really far out
target that we think makes sense
actually i'll get to the reactions in a
second but i think it makes a lot of
sense to say okay
we're just going to set this target out
so you guys all know everybody in canada
you all know
by 2035 don't plan on actually having
the ability to buy a gas car
starting in this year um
couple deeper thoughts on that one today
and probably forever canada's cold and
so
electric cars in canada specifically
have a harder time in the winter because
the range is less because you have to
heat up the battery and
that's been something people in
northeast deal with they pretty much
only sell all-wheel drive cars in canada
no one wants rear-wheel drive in canada
because it snows out there
you need a certain type of car and so
for that reason a lot of canadians have
avoided evs
because they have much worse range in
the winter yeah i think i actually wrote
something down that it's only like
three percent of cars sold in canada or
ev
yeah so if you're thinking about and
that's like you know three percent
sounds very small but that's still like
three out of every 100 cars sold
that are new are electric that's like
that's it's pretty low but it's not bad
yeah um i'm just thinking like all right
so by
2035 14 years from now will the tech
be good enough i think so but will the
tech be good enough that that range drop
off in the winter is no longer a concern
i hope so but i just want to talk
about the two different reactions that
i've seen to this headline so
again the headline is canada banning the
sale of new fuel-powered cars
and light trucks by 2035. uh the two
different reactions i've seen are 20 35
is
way too late and the other is 20 35 is
way too early
that's the two very different reactions
i've seen
um i don't know if i fall in
one camp or the other i think this is a
pretty reasonable
like target if i'm agree with you
completely
i think this is a great headline
uh a very a perfect headline for people
who
for journalists and and news websites
pretty much like
this is going to get reactions because
of that people are looking at this at
total extremes the sale of new i wish i
had a statistic here but like
new cars are they're so they sell a lot
but if you look at how many people buy
used cars because
they're cheaper and they're still super
reliable like the used sale
market is insane yeah so there's still
going to be so many gas cars
sold in 2035 in canada as long as all
this stays there so with all the evs
increasing we're going to see a lot less
gas cars but there are still going to be
a ton of gas cars yeah and that's just
for regular
consumers too yeah and so the the
line right under the headline is canada
will ban the sale of fuel burning cars
and new light duty trucks from 2035 in
an effort to reach
net zero emissions across the country by
2050
so like you said people are still gonna
keep buying gas cars but eventually
eventually the turnover
as people get new cars will be so much
that we can
try to attack this net zero emissions
thing but
yeah that first reaction of 2035 is way
too late
on one hand i get that because we're i
don't know if you just i just retweeted
another random video of
the ocean on fire like the climate
crisis is real
it's 100 it's pretty real and the fact
that you know we we give it another 14
15 years of sort of business as usual
not really incentivizing buying electric
cars i mean i think there is a tax
incentive in canada but it's just not
the same as
banning gas cars so another 15 years of
gas cars
to a lot of people seems like a long
time but the other half of that
2035 is way too early i think comes from
people who are looking at the current
state of electric cars
and the infrastructure importantly
around them and that is a much bigger
challenge
because now that we have you know
there's good electric cars out
i think you can buy today in canada an
all-wheel drive
model three and be pretty happy despite
like a little less range in the winter
but the charging networks all the other
alt alternate i'll guess i'll call them
evs that don't charge at tesla
superchargers
but all the other evs that don't charge
a tesla superchargers that have to rely
on
the infrastructure that's being built
out right now that to
that seems kind of bleak like if you're
looking at the current
state of okay if i were to get an
electric car sometime in the next few
years would that be okay
um so that's where a lot of people are
coming from they're like i don't have a
garage i need to depend on where the
chargers are and there's nothing
anywhere near my house i live in this
part of canada
uh and i get that too so it's it's right
in the middle i find that funny because
to me infrastructure seems like
something where
15 years from now i don't see it being
any issue
i think you're probably right i think
just we're seeing such an influx in all
these other people
joining the you know the eevee thing
that they're going to have to figure out
chargers just like
chargers are going to be something that
just blow up soon and and the charging
aspect of it
well clearly there's like technology
involved in it
i don't think it's as crazy as creating
a whole car
at a certain price point and all that
like infrastructure has to happen and
they're
you know their cars are going to be like
affected by it so they're going to have
to pump that out fast
and they're already pumping it out
decently well i think tesla
and all the other manufacturers
infrastructure wise will be everywhere
in 15 15 years is a long time
in the tech i'll be 45
in 2035 i hope i really hope you're
right but it's also like
it's more than even just building
chargers there's a lot of people saying
like the grid
can't handle that many new chargers like
we want there to be
right and that that's like billions of
dollars in building and stuff where
we're like all right
we need to make as many chargers as
there are gas stations
sure we can pour money into building the
chargers but can we support
all of the cars in canada using all of
those chargers all the time
that's like underground type
infrastructure will that be ready in 14
years
that i don't i don't know about and i
guess the other thing is if this is
i mean 2035 isn't the net zero emissions
part but 2050 is and
not all ev chargers are producing zero
emissions like
you're getting electricity from coal
burning
places at some point like right they're
causing emissions that's just
some so i think it's a great step like
you said i don't think it's
as intense as either of those sides look
but i
i'm super i cannot wait well i can wait
to be 45 but i cannot wait to see
what the landscape of evs and just cars
in general
are going to be up there and i applaud
canada for taking a stance like this
um you said too and this is something i
wondered and hopefully
someone in the comments or on discord or
something can help us out here but
uh we have term limits in the u.s so i
think this would be super hard for a
president of the u.s to ever
pledge or or ban because in 15 years
they're gone jesus is gonna say the next
person's not just gonna overwrite that
i don't know how it works in canada and
i think the uk has made a similar pledge
banning them by 2030 i think um
but i also don't know how elections work
in both of those will these
prime ministers be there until that time
to oversee it
uh yeah i think that's all interesting i
don't think that you guys could do it
california though has
as a state has none of it right that's
kind of what i'd more expect in the u.s
yeah
but yeah it's always funny when you see
these deadlines set so far out
i feel like they always move like
whenever you're like oh we're going to
do this thing
remember like 10 years ago when we heard
about how many evs they'd be making by
2020 and 2025
and they're not really doing i remember
that i remember like two or three years
ago when they all started doing like
anywhere from
25 to 50 almost every car manufacturer
has pledged
but i spent a couple missed deadlines oh
i'm sure
yeah i think those two together though
might be what kind of puts us
in the right direction though because
you know i'm a car manufacturer and i
promise by
2050 to have purely ev
but i'm a car manufacturer and i can
change that whenever i want because i
don't really care and when you're a big
company
you don't seem to hit the repercussions
quite as hard as
some other places but but if now you
have a
potential total loss of sales in a
country i mean
canada's with the second largest country
by land mass which
obviously is different population-wise
they have a lot of the
um the northern aspects of it but like
it's not a small country to be taking
sales away from
so if i'm a car manufacturer now it's
like oh no i'm gonna lose a huge
especially those big like i'm sure
subaru does really well up there with
all-wheel drive i'm sure toyota does
great up there i'm sure probably
just right up there yeah sure so like
they're all probably now
like okay i need to take our pledge a
little more seriously because we're
gonna lose this huge chunk
of sales over there yeah to me the the
the companies themselves
pledging to move to evs by a certain
year to me
feels like part pr part
a little bit of internal pressure like
we're gonna we want to be good at evs so
let's just tell ourselves we're gonna be
good at evs but like you know if we miss
the date like what who's gonna
what's gonna happen nothing's really
gonna come down and punish us where
this coming from the other side where
it's like you won't be allowed to sell
here by this year
if you don't make an ev yeah and if you
only offer a bad eevee like others will
swallow your sales and you'll be
pretty much out of that connection you
lose all your loyalty for when you do
come out with the eevee it's just like a
different pressure cycle yeah totally
different pressures so
that is why i do appreciate this move
from canada um
but yeah i still do want to see you know
a little more promises from the
companies themselves
and i call them promises but they're
just kind of like setting
vague targets yes
statements the stock price goes up look
they said they'd make 50 evs
yeah okay great well i want to see him
so that's where i'm at uh
but i appreciate this um real quick
while we were discussing all that adam
looked up i mentioned
new cars versus used cars before uh
he found a quote that says in 2019 17
million total vehicles were sold in the
us
the rate at which second-hand vehicles
increased
double compared to new cars so not two
times as many new cars
but the rate at which they're being sold
so that's the thing we're seeing all
these new cars that are having longer
and longer lives so like
the secondary value of them becomes
stays really good and the
secondary car industry is great so like
that's going to keep
going i would not doubt if there are a
couple people are going to be like we're
going to build gas cars right up to 2035
and they're going to continue to sell at
our
100 car dealerships and every every year
that the gas car gets better
they last a little bit longer i think i
was reading about this too but like the
the average
lifespan of a car meaning the average
amount of time someone keeps the car
they just bought
for a new car is longer than ever and
for a lot of
tech things it's longer longer than ever
but basically if you keep selling your
gas car
right up until 2030 2035 they might keep
that new gas car
for eight nine years until so yeah the
the whole
cycle of like transitioning to
sustainable energy for transportation is
a long one
this is just one step to hopefully
expedite that
cycle that turnover but yeah to me
that's why i think the people on the
side of
this is way too early why are we doing
this it'll never work
feels like not a great argument listen
trust me i'm sure there are people out
there that
that have maybe decent arguments but if
your argument is just like i like gas
cars
and i enjoy gas cars better than ev
i can't agree with you on that because
if the world
gets way too hot and none of us can live
in it anymore who cares what car you're
driving might be a hot take
that might be a hot taste hot hot
very hot hot a literal hot take yeah all
right let's talk about ipad os
15. okay the newest version of
ios for the ipad so okay i did a video
about ios 15 first
lots of really cool features um facetime
has
share play built in now there's this
live text feature in the gallery where
you can select text wherever you want
lots of really cool stuff definitely
watch that video if you haven't already
then we also covered we made a video
showing ipad os 15.
now this is one that has some
expectations to it right so
m1 ipad pro came out and it's this crazy
powerful chip
benchmarks over the 16-inch macbook pro
16 gigs of ram and a tablet we're we're
all looking at this like okay
the ipad has reached yet another
ridiculous performance peak
and it's just still an ipad what are
they gonna do with this
right so this is before wwdc and i had a
little montage in the video because i
there's a lot of us sort of talking
about this like
well maybe ipad os 15 is going to be
finally like unlocking some new features
some new power some window management
something
something to take advantage of this year
because the ipad's crazy overpowered
right
so it comes out it's the it's announced
the wwdc developer beta
i install it we start using it it's
basically
the same thing it's it's very similar it
does have some pretty cool features
again it has all the same ios stuff we
were talking about
live text it's got share play and
facetime it's got the new maps it's all
shiny and with all these little tiny
trees and everything very cool
performance is great i've been using it
it's actually a really stable beta the
public beta now
but on ipad os specifically there's like
three major new ui tweaks
and none of them for me really changed
the way i use the ipad like i was maybe
i got my hopes up a little too high for
this
i think a lot of people did we probably
did but they are pretty cool the big one
number one is
you can put widgets anywhere on the home
screen now neat i've been doing that on
android for like
10 years now so that's that's great
appreciate that apple
uh two it's the same multitasking
fundamentals but they've surfaced it now
with uh these three dots that appear at
the top of the screen everywhere you go
it's either full screen app split screen
app or slide over app yeah
and before on the ipad i actually really
like this because i
don't really use slide over like i just
forget about that gesture
and a lot of times if i'm thinking about
doing split screen i will
remember how many gestures i have to do
to do it and i'll just just walk
never mind i'll just go back and forth
i'll go back and forth that's fine
um but the fact that these three dots
pop up everywhere now
every time you're in an app makes me a
power user
more likely to go in and split screen
because it's just always a tap away
and now real quick if i remember so i
wasn't here last week when you guys
filmed all this so i didn't get to see
most of it working but if i remember
correctly from wwdc
were they dot or it was almost like a
little menu right that kind of
showed what it's doing so like screen
was like a
oh you tap the top first tap the dots it
expands shows you that okay okay and
then you pick one which i remember that
menu being like oh yeah
people are going to use this way more
because they can they remember what it
can do
instead of having to know the gestures
from it yeah that's that's like the best
that is basically why i love it
sometimes because you remember that you
can do it all the time
so i do split screen a little more often
than i used to um
but the last thing is quick notes which
is it's literally just an apple notes
feature i don't
i didn't use apple notes either very
much i use pocket i use other note
taking apps i use
tick tick uh google keep doesn't matter
now with apple notes you can swipe up
from the corner at any point
in ipad os and it'll give you a quick
note and you can just write something
down and save it kind of like you could
if you're on the lock screen in samsung
i was going to bring that and it's a
samsung note it's this i actually used
to use that pretty often like
between like getting ready to go to the
grocery store and like
walking through the parking lot i'll
just be like oh yeah and just whip out
the that was the only thing i used the
pen for
so good it was really nice it was it was
almost like that one thing like oh i'm
not a big stylus guy but there is this
one really useful feature
that was huge for me yeah so this feels
kind of like the same thing if you have
a pen
or you could also just do this with the
keyboard yeah you just swipe it from the
corner
you get a quick note you type whatever
down you swipe it away you just saved it
to quick notes
easy the nice little bit is it will
actually talk to other things on the
screen underneath it so this is kind of
like a ui thing i think
craig's probably pretty responsible for
um which basically like if you're in a
browser and you pop up a quick note
you can just add that link right into
the quick note and then write something
you can highlight something on the page
and when you come back to that quick
note later and click on the link it'll
bring you back
highlight the same thing on the page so
you're now a little more plugged into
the ui
a little more like interactive with your
notes i guess
which i liked i thought that was good
can you share those quick notes
good question um i believe so that would
be huge i'm thinking right now like
okay i want to share this recipe with
something i found it on this
blog or whatever and for those of you
who
look up recipes online it is like a
you have to read a novel about why they
love this recipe so much
and then you get to the ingredients and
then you get to how to make it and
and if you like cooking a lot you
generally take a base recipe
and you make changes to it so i would
love to link
highlight past the sob story that they
made on why they enjoy making macaroni
and cheese
i would just like to share with somebody
with a couple notes i put like you know
maybe this was too much milk maybe this
wasn't enough cheese i like using this
type of pasta
and send that whole note to somebody
that would be amazing
that i believe you can share individual
notes okay so
including all the like highlights and
everything that part i wanna i'm gonna
double check that i think that would be
really cool that would be really awesome
kind of the same way how if you took a
screenshot on a samsung phone and
immediately annotated the screenshot you
could send that annotated screenshot to
somebody
that was cool because you had the stylus
and you could just start drawing on
stuff and send that drawing with your
circles and your notes um
with these quick links and these plugins
and hotkeys i don't
know if all of that will translate but i
know it's useful
even for yourself for saving things oh
yeah i would still love it yeah
so i you know it's not the revolutionary
changes the way i use the ipad type
software update maybe some of us were
getting our hopes up for
but i don't want to let my expectations
be the thief of my joy
i want i want to just enjoy ipad os for
what it is
and for the couple people like me who
are maybe teetering
on on just getting rid of the macbook
entirely
i'm just gonna tell you it's not gonna
push you over the edge there's nothing
like extra here
for the file system or for window
management that's gonna really make you
go
okay now i can get rid of the macbook
now i don't have to have two things in
my backpack
um so the ipad maintains its position as
a secondary computer to me
and that's fine i don't really mind that
but yeah i i think there's a lot of
people who are waiting for like maybe
something a little more
that we didn't quite get here's the
here's the other side of that just to
say
you know maybe i don't know if this is
devil's advocate but this software
that i'm reviewing now on a thousand
dollar ipad pro with an m1 chip that i
was hoping for some extra power features
for
this ipad os is going to be on every
ipad right i think
we mentioned this on an earlier episode
but like the 329
ipad for education like the ipad airs
every single other one of these ipads is
going to have
the three dots the quick notes all these
better features from ipad os and ios 15.
and they all just got that much better
yeah so while the thousand dollar ipad
with m1 disappointingly doesn't get
pushed over the edge of
cannibalizing macbook sales i i can't
say that doesn't shock me because all
the other ipods
ipads get better too and that's just
kind of where they live
in between iphones and macbooks it
sounds like i'm just conceding
the ipad being not great i wanted to ask
that question
do you think there ever comes a point
which is funny because they made all the
ads like
what is a computer but are they ever
going to
over overtake the macbook
i think as long or like even be uh even
be at the point where like
people are choosing between those two
and like
it is doing enough to kind of be at the
macbook level
because i've heard arguments on both
sides yes there are definitely people
now that are choosing between the two
maybe between a macbook air and an ipad
pro with a keyboard case or whatever
and i think it just it really is very
dependent on workflow this sounds like a
cop-out answer but like
for a lot of people the ipad will do
everything you want it to do
i'm saying ipad os is not the reason it
now does everything you want to do it
already did
everything you wanted it to do just a
little more easily
okay let me rephrase the question a
little bit okay if you were because like
i can see a lot of people doing that
who maybe haven't grown up on laptops as
long do you think there is anyone who
has a macbook or macbook pro
that is going to be like my next device
is strictly ipad
does that make that a little tougher yes
because of all the things you are used
to on that i think one i was watching
linus i believe and he was kind of
making this argument that i
he doesn't think it will ever quite do
that and one of those is like
just file transfers and stuff like that
is so much different and
and i couldn't believe it but he says if
i transfer a file unless i sit there and
watch the thing tick the whole time you
have to go like
do something do something and then go
back i never get any confirmation that
it finished filing so i have to
go check myself and that just like you
wait for it to appear yeah
yeah that's the type of thing so
i think there are a lot of things like
that that apple could do
to make the computer user be more
comfortable only using an ipad
but in general and i don't
i kind of want to be wrong here but i
think as long as apple
sells a computer yep their what's a
computer thing is really just
advertising they're not going to overlap
the computers they also sell yeah
because they're cannibalizing their own
sales in that sense so why would they
yes they didn't get to be a two trillion
dollar company by
oops we're not that good at business we
accidentally cannibalized their own
sales like they're pretty good at this
stuff
i mean they did kind of maybe this isn't
the best example but they did kind of do
it with
ipod how so with
remember even that like random ipod they
threw out like two years ago was
like we bought it and we're instantly
like why on earth would anybody buy this
i it is kind of different i think i
think it got cannibalized by the times
we live in
like the fact that the iphone has an
ipod
built into it it completely 100
overlapped and people would buy the ipod
if they just wanted a cheaper version
and didn't need the phone features
where like if people are choosing
between an ipad and a computer
it's not so simple where you're just
like yo do i want the keyboard or not
like it's it's a very software workflow
problem that you just have to commit to
uh but yeah i think the ipad the ipod
was a victim of of the time do you think
there's a specific
accessory the ipad where if they like
perfectly nailed it could be that final
leap over
and like let's imagine this would be the
leap where apple would basically kind of
like
decide to stop selling macbooks and sell
only ipads i feel like it's keyboard
yeah for me i was going to say like the
balance of it if they made a keyboard
that really balanced as well as a
macbook does
which is really hard because the ipad
weighs a lot more than the screen of
this laptop
exactly but if they could pull that off
if they made like some sort of a surface
like
magnet prong thing and now you have like
a four pound laptop but it's weighted
perfectly
i at that point i could stop using my
macbook
okay but i i knew we need final cut and
pro apps
i don't know i don't personally yeah i
don't personally edit on the laptop but
i would love to see pro apps
on the ipad pro um that being said yeah
i'm
i don't see that happening anytime i
don't either because it would sacrifice
portability so it would have to be some
crazy invention in the future that
somehow pulls that off
with still making yeah even third-party
companies aren't making that it's like
such an engineering i think the ipad
weighs 1.6
pounds the ipad pro and so if you want
it to
wait in a way where you can just sit
like a normal laptop
the bass has to weigh at least 1.6
pounds which it does by the way the ipad
i think is 1.5 and the
the base of the magic keyboard is 1.6
and it's already like kind of teetering
and i put it on my lap and it just falls
right over
i'd need something to be like 2.5 pounds
now you're talking like
twice the weight of an actual macbook
for what a touch screen
for ios like for this weird no yeah i
i can't imagine this what it looks like
and i'm excited to see if it ever
happens
what that like new new technology is
that
allows it to to reach that level maybe
one day the ipad pro is like
super thin and light i think that's what
would have to be the the ipad basically
has to be as
light as a computer screen a laptop
screen
that would be would have to be working
pretty sick that's
maybe by 2030 new ben gates right there
easy
yeah that's the that's the obvious
downside of that
zach come on man um all right well we
also i got one more thing i want to talk
about
rivian's uh r1t there's a video
uh tweeted by the ceo rj uh which is
just uh just a video of him like taking
a kitchen out the side of
the truck no big deal small small detail
um do you want to try and describe that
a little better for audiences
because just pulling a kitchen sink out
of a that is a great point
yeah okay so for audio audio only
listeners
uh picture a pickup truck and if you've
seen an r1t you might actually know
about the i think it's called the gear
tunnel or something like that
yeah which lives right behind the back
seats and right in front of the bed so
it's in that weird area where
it's just usually i guess gas tanks um
and inside of that we've seen videos of
people putting coolers and like
surfboards and golf clubs and things i
can fit like in that column which is
pretty cool
in this video they pull out what's
basically a module that
fully fills the space they set it up
it's got a kickstand and they open that
module and it's like a sink
a stove top like a cutting board it's
just this whole camping kitchen thing
and i was watching that i was like okay
first of all very cool
not that many people are gonna buy it
but i love it's gonna be great for
people who do want that
yeah and this is a great example to me
of an ev just doing something that gas
cars can't
just do something something to get
people to go oh
that's why i'd get an electric car over
a gas car it's because
i literally can't i don't have room for
that in my car
if you put it in the trunk maybe but
like there's all kinds of weird extra
spaces you get from going electric
there's no gas tank there's no
transmission there's no
drive shaft in the middle of a car
there's all the stuff that gets opened
up
uh and this is just a cool thing to put
there which is
what i enjoy i mean i think the tunnel
in general is really cool and that's the
best way to describe it i feel like it
kind of looks like the vive logo
almost like a rounded triangle yeah and
just imagine that yeah under your seat
but you open it from the outsides and
you can look straight through it
and yeah they have this like whole
kitchen thing that it slides out and
then
pops forward now to me this is the
biggest design flaw
because the way it pops up and your
space is
if you're looking at the truck it pops
out towards the passenger side door
where it then blocks the passenger side
door completely
so you can't open the door so like if
you have something in there you either
have to go through the front door
and through the back so i feel like it
just popped out towards the trunk it
would totally eliminate
that issue yeah um that feels minor
like but like a pretty obvious yeah just
get on the other side
get out the other door yeah but but i do
agree it feels like although it feels
kind of gimmicky and i do think a lot of
people who are buying a car
specifically because they want to take a
camping lot probably have a bunch of
camping gear already that they would
probably rather just store under there i
wonder if there's any sort of like
module plug-in happening where you can
use battery power to like power the
stove
and like there's other things that this
module does to talk to the truck
it's gotta be battery powered because it
looked like an electric range right so
it's gotta be running off of that
it's not like a propane hookup so
imagine like you don't need a generator
and a propane hookup anymore
you just have the truck and the truck is
the battery power for the stove
and like your whatever other plug-ins
you have i think that's neat i'd rather
cook over a campfire if i'm camping
that's usually the point but yeah um
yeah glamping
it's clapping yeah i mean i get it i
think it's cool
um i i think it's kind of gimmicky but
at the same time i think these gimmicks
are like the best pr moves ever because
that video is going to get shared
everywhere and it's going to get people
thinking about evs actually
it's really fun i shared it yeah i think
i think i'm i'm looking forward to more
of these things
you know i saw cyber truck and one of
the things cybertruck did obviously
besides the cyber quad in the back which
is
technically another thing that you can
do it'll be an electric quad that plugs
into the truck's battery
cool but also there is a lot of
high-powered
plugs in the back f-150 lightning did
this the
huge front trunk in the f-150 lightning
was another thing where you're like
i have a pickup truck i don't really
have like a small
trunk of sealed storage that's the thing
i heard from a lot of pickup truck
drivers in the comments of like i don't
have to buy like a
cover for my back my tailgate if i just
have rocks and stuff in there but i also
want to have like
two backpacks and and a laptop and stuff
just put it in the front trunk
people in the back seat have if you've
seen a lot of pickup drivers their
backseat is just stored
exactly so this that that was cool to
see cyber truck also had
a solar panel that rolled
i'm not even sure if this is really
going to happen but it rolled out of the
back of the truck and
covered it no no that was a whole
separate module but this was just like
the cover for the
for the cyber truck that i think jay
leno like stood on or franz maybe stood
on top of
i think elon did this he just walked up
on top and was like see it's strong it
can hold me
but that was solar panels and that would
allegedly
give you maybe a little extra juice or
be able to check i could see that as
something that's
charging the accessories you're using
like that feels
yeah cool i guess i don't know how you'd
roll uh whatever
the whole point is this is a good one
this is a good example of
a thing that an electric car can do
that a gas car straight up can't that
gives people a real reason to want one
so whether it's this whether it's
instant torque or a faster
60 or a front trunk or
not killing the earth or or not killing
earth that works too or glamping
whatever it is you want to do
okay this is more important i like to
see stuff like this so
shout out to them hopefully we can get
r1t here someday and maybe uh autofocus
episode
i would love that that'd be pretty fun
though then we we have to go glamping we
have to
don't make promises you can't keep
marketing because i love that video
it's part of the experience we'll see
you can camp in that i'll camp in a tent
we'll see who's more comfortable
and who can cook more we have to catch
all our own stuff though i'm just
kidding that's a wrench
that is a big wrench that's not clamping
all right well we'll end it there
