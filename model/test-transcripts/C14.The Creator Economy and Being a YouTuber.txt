all right welcome back to another
episode of the waveform podcast we're
your hosts i'm marquez and i'm andrew
and today is a very special episode of
the waveform podcast i would say for a
couple reasons but number one first
in-person guests we've ever had in the
new waveform studio colin smear welcome
to waveform thank you we're honored to
be here so some of my favorite youtube
creators and i my goal is to have all of
my favorite creators come to studio so
we can talk about youtube and talk about
everything related to this job but we
share this job of making videos on the
internet and i have a lot of questions
that are sort of generally in the like
creator economy world and we'll talk
about a bunch of that stuff but
for the for the uninitiated do you have
like a like a spiel that you give for
like
we have we have many
many spiel will do it as quickly as
possible sure um we started on youtube
10 years ago
we started making extremely niche
content on youtube just because there
was no other place to make it and it was
all content about the sport of lacrosse
which we played right both of us played
that and that kind of helped us navigate
through this
you know this world of making content
and aggregating a community of
like-minded people that that really
couldn't exist anywhere else and it was
a network and and content that we wish
we had when we were younger like we wish
we had a place to hang out and watch
videos about athletes and you know what
was going on in our community and so
we went through that process um we built
a network we turned it from one channel
to 60 channels and we ended up selling
the company in 2014.
we stayed on it with the sports company
that bought us and we worked with you
know all types of different creators
most notably dude perfect
uh found our way through like working
with brands working with creators and
fell in love with just this
just the world of youtube because it
gave us a career and we felt like we
wanted to help others get a career as
well so today we make content about
creators for creators
where you know not only are we
trying to tell the stories of creators
but also having creators like you on the
show to
help people who are just starting out or
even other people in this career learn
about what is this career of being a
creator and how do we pull a community
together of people who are taking this
really seriously and want to do it as a
profession yeah i've been watching you
guys videos on
creators and interviews on the youtube
landscape for a while you've been also
andrew you've been watching a couple of
them i've been telling everybody to
watch them just because they're really
good but also like let's find as many
different ways to tie these experiences
we've had together as we can
um but one of the common things i've
noticed so we've talked about like
everything from like the mr beast of the
world to all the other tech youtube
creators and one thing that i keep
noticing that i always want to like
explore is
the advice that you can get from a
creator about youtube about the platform
about how to make better videos doesn't
necessarily always apply
and so watching so i'll just go ahead
and plug right off the bat it'll be in
the show notes the video you did with
jimmy where you hung out with him you
were in his studio get all kinds of this
awesome information out of him and about
youtube and about the way he approaches
making videos and i want to listen to
that whole thing and just just take
every little bit of advice i possibly
can to make our videos better
but not all of it actually works and
applies to tech so i'll just give a
quick example you might say something
like
you really want to be
introducing people to a story line
within the first 10 seconds of a video
but that bit of advice might not work if
you're trying to review a product for
example and you have to talk to the
person considering buying the thing
immediately they would leave if you
started telling a story and it has
nothing to do with the product
so i'm curious when you guys talk to a
bunch of different creators in different
genres who have different
pieces of advice that they give
do you find that there's more overlap or
almost no overlap between let's say a
beauty creator or a tech creator or a
vlogger and all the different types of
youtubers you've talked to so i
personally actually disagree about
what you just said about tech videos
interesting i actually think you can
introduce multiple narratives introduce
new stories when it comes to the product
it's just not the same way it's not you
telling a story but if you said like
there's two things i really like about
this and one thing i really don't
all of a sudden you've just introduced
something that i'm waiting for i see
that's a story what's the thing marquez
doesn't like about this and i'm waiting
for that and so i think actually a lot
of the advice that he's giving is
the way i take it is more of this just
general storytelling advice
and if someone's
you know you're introducing a product
and there's no tension there's no
nothing new that's gonna happen
um
then i might not stick around and i
think you know i think colin should
explain also this advice from the
creators of south park when it comes to
storytelling and i actually think
storytelling advice applies to everyone
who's telling a story
yeah there's this
clip where the creators of south park
are speaking to a class and they said
that a really bad story will go like
this it'll go this happened then this
happened then this happened then this
happened and you think like that's an
extremely boring way to intake
information yeah and what you want is a
story that goes this happened
but then that happened
therefore this happened
so you want some causation between the
beats in your story and i think that's
something that could exist completely in
a tech video where you're saying here's
this new phone that was just launched
history has shown us that it's been
really incredible it's been an
incredible line of products but
this one is different
therefore you should think differently
right and if you can keep that going
throughout you'll hook people and keep
them longer i think one of the
interesting things about reviewing tech
products is a large
part of what we do is actually deciding
which products to review especially if
i'm just like narrowing it down to
reviewers
and so it usually turns out that the
stuff we review is at the most extremes
it's either the best stuff and we want
to highlight it and show you
or it's like the worst stuff and it's
like i gotta warn you not to buy this
and then there's a whole bunch of stuff
in the middle that's like
most tech which is like fine
and sometimes it can be really hard to
pull a story out of the stuff that's
fine like you'll you'll get to this
whole line of products has been fine
this one's
also fine
stay tuned
so i find like a lot of channels are
like trying to pull a story not even a
story but just trying to like exaggerate
things to create a better video which
may actually shift
the conclusion about the product yeah so
i think there's two things one it's like
the way you the way you reveal
information to the audience
is
you know part of that kind of retention
strategy that you can pull it's like
okay i'm gonna save this piece of
information for there but i'm gonna tell
them i'm gonna say
there's a little bit of like i can hook
them but i also think there's completely
different
tension and release points in different
formats so
all good storytelling is gonna build a
ton of tension in the viewer and then
release it right that's what it is it's
like i'm i wanna i'm curious about
something and then you let me know and
so i think a tech review is inherently a
bunch of tension because it's like i
wanna know marquez's take on this and so
that that's the tension the release is
watching it so i agree with you that
it's not apples to apples but i also
would say that i think that
some of the storytelling advice that you
can take from
you know someone who's able to capture
you know 100 million people's attention
then i think you can apply small bits of
that and i think
the the thing is like jimmy on our
interview but then also jimmy uh
spending four days with him in north
carolina like the in-between moments
you get a lot of jimmy where he's just
speaking more directly to us at least
like about our content and being more
you know kind of understanding of what
our goals are and so i think the more
time we spent together the more
he started giving us advice that was
catered to our channel and i think
that's a pretty unique experience yeah
um but i think there's like general
storytelling advice and and at the same
time i would say that
you know he reaches an incredibly broad
audience
the most the most broad and i think
there's different tactics to building a
niche community
and i think the way i view the internet
and how i like to interact with it is
through niche communities i mean our
first business was
a network a sports network dedicated to
lacrosse yeah that's a niche community
that i'm a part of and the creator
community is another niche community i
feel a part of right and so now i think
we're creating content for that
community so i want to be a little bit
more narrow
and i don't actually want the most broad
audience
yeah and we won't take his advice to the
fullest extreme because if we did our
videos would be edited down to six
minutes for retention they would take us
forever and we would leave out valuable
things sometimes letting someone speak
for us for four to five minutes is
valuable yeah right and so we need to
make that decision of yeah no our
audience because we know them because it
is niche wants to hear about that right
got it
do you think you would you think you
would last in a mr beast challenge
which challenge i'm trying to think i
feel like i'd be pretty decent keeping
your hand on something i mean keeping
your hand on a phone that's his app i
could definitely get my hands on this
no i'm pretty i'm pretty um i'm decently
like mobile and athletic and i don't i
don't know
like if i if you put me up against other
creators and editors i would feel pretty
confident because most creating and
editing is like sitting down like
endurance yeah i feel like i have a
little bit of a
physical advantage but again it depends
on the channel so you could sit in a
seat with poor posture for probably the
longest
hours
um all right so a lot of what we've
talked about also
in the youtube world is youtube as a
platform has relationship with its
creators
in a way that not every platform does
like not every platform sends plaques to
its creators when they reach milestones
and has like creator you know teams that
work with us and things like that
um i'm curious from you what are like
the biggest complaints that you've seen
from creators to youtube because i feel
like here were
i don't want to say isolated but it
seems like every
gate or every like
big problem that youtube has
seemingly seemingly doesn't really
affect our channel very much whether
that's because we're a tech channel or
we're a pg channel or a friendly channel
to youtube whatever it is it seems like
we've been pretty safe from all of it
and i guess that's why but i'm curious
what sort of things you guys see that
ring true the most often among other
creators i think the number one
complaint from creators that i hear is
the inability to a b test thumbnails
because i think yeah thumbnails are this
like incredibly stressful um part of our
job do you remember when it was just
like the middle frame of the video
yeah you could game that system pretty
easily and totally became like you need
to be a partner to upload a thumbnail
yep and now everyone who is like
anyone can upload thumbnails now right i
think yeah i think so yeah but like
thumbnail designer is becoming it's
great that it's becoming like a job in
our world right like that's like that's
a difference between
a million views and a hundred thousand
views a lot of times is your thumbnail
but i think that's the the most
stressful part of creating is that you
make this amazing video not only do you
have to be like to be a youtuber not
only do you have to be
um
good on camera you also have to be a
good
producer you also just be a good
director a good animator good editor
like you have to be all these different
things and then on top of that you have
to be really good at packaging and
that's actually what you find out over
time is that actually the most important
part of the job then yeah and i think
the importance of that is really
positive because it
increases like the the barrier entry and
makes the quality really good but i
think thumbnails today are causing a lot
of creators a lot of stress and are
the biggest complaint is like can we
just a b test yeah it seems like it's
such a simple fix um but i would say
that's the biggest complaint it would be
nice we were just talking about this the
other day but um
would you be uh open to being able to
change so
when it kind of auto plays on your say
your smart tv or like when you're
hovering over something on the web and
you don't get to choose what that
autoplays like being able to now change
that similar to a thumbnail and you
think that could increase
click through yeah definitely i think
you can choose that on uh
on instagram reels and yeah yeah just
like being able to do that yeah because
we've had ones where we just released a
studio video where we had the rivie and
it has this like gear tunnel in the
bottom and the clip it shows was tim
crawling through that gear tunnel so
like super fun right we've had other
reviews where it chooses
like half of that one second is marquez
and a role and the other half is
switching to b-roll and looks terrible
when yeah like goes up
that happens sometimes well they'll
choose b-roll or a graphic that doesn't
really have to do exactly with the video
yeah and i've chosen stuff on my like
smart tv because i accidentally scrolled
over it and that one clip was like that
was kind of interesting i think i'm
gonna watch the video now yeah i believe
that's uh ai selected at this point
whether it's be from retention or just
from a random i think i try and choose a
face
usually yeah yeah i mean all of my
videos have a face in them sometimes it
doesn't pick a face and i find that odd
but yeah i i think so i see a lot of i
agree with ab testing thumbnails i think
that would be
great i would use that for sure um so i
agree definitely that a b testing
thumbnails would be fun i would love to
i would do that all the time but
i also am probably among the youtubers
that i know and associate with in the
tech world i'm probably the one that
changes my thumbnails the least i think
i see a lot of people upload a video
with a title and a thumbnail and then an
hour later change the title and then an
hour later change the thumbnail and then
change the title and the thumbnail and
i'll come across it a third time in my
home on my home feed or something i'm
like i think i've watched this already
but it has a different title and
thumbnail so maybe i haven't
um
would you do you guys play with title
and thumbnail at all do you find that
that's like a major
major part of how you package a video
and manipulating it and changing the way
it performs or not we do play with them
but from my perspective if we're
frantically changing titles and
thumbnails we made a mistake much
earlier in the process
if if we have good ideas make titles and
thumbnails easy yeah so we try and make
sure we have that figured out before we
even make the decision
to start filming or scripting the video
yeah it's kind of changed our process to
to just say hey let's start that way in
the beginning and say okay we have this
idea but wait before we take any other
steps yeah how do you package this idea
yeah i think one of the conversations i
had with jimmy was like
when do you pick the title and thumbnail
and for him it's before the video even
gets shot at all
and for us we were like well that sounds
like great advice let's see how early we
can apply it but if we're reviewing a
piece of tech and we don't know how good
it is and we don't know if we're going
to recommend it or not i can't choose a
title and thumbnail before testing the
thing so i got to test the thing
and then maybe at that point when i'm
starting to write the actual video i can
pick a title and thumbnail but that's
much later in the process and at that
point i don't know anymore if it's a
good title and thumbnail but that might
be with new formats because you have a
lot of formats too where you know first
impressions you're going to put that in
the title that is true yeah and so
that's what we're in the process of
finding or what are our formats where we
it'll make it easy for us and for our
audience that does they'll get kind of
annoying sometimes when we we know we
have to put galaxy s21 ultra first
impressions now the actual title we give
it basically has to be
three to four words like where we have
to limit ourselves from that so that's
kind of a pain sometimes um but yeah it
is nice to be able to just always say
impressions or something like that half
the time our titles
are created
in the uploading process yes video is
done we're still brainstorming it yeah i
have a i have this checklist of like the
process of making a video and it's
usually as i'm uploading the video
that i am
finishing what i think the title should
be i have my last two or three options
for a title and we're shooting the
thumbnail at that moment
and i don't know if that's
i mean there are lots of tech topics and
other ways to come up with a title and
thumbnail first and craft a video around
it but specifically for reviews that's
been a challenge of mine is like
packaging the video
in an earlier than as i upload way
that's like us for interviews you know
we just filmed an interview with you we
don't know exactly what the title
thumbnail's gonna be yeah we have like a
loose idea going into the interview
coolest guy ever yes that was it yeah
yeah yeah yeah okay yeah that might work
there's i think the other complaint
about
the other common complaint is like i
don't make enough money
you know adsense
you know this that or the other and my
perspective on that is for so many years
because we were in such a niche topic
adsense was not a part of our business
model at all
and i don't believe that youtube owes us
anything for uploading videos to youtube
just don't believe it and and i think my
perspective is just that
it's our job to make a business out of
it if we can find audience that's that's
on us youtube gives us the platform and
it's a search engine and they give us
the tech
adsense i always look as like
it's a cherry on top of our business
luckily i think over the past year our
growth has been such that it's a it's a
nice cherry on top but i just don't view
it i think any creator is starting out
and being like frustrated that
youtube's not paying enough yeah it's
like you you have to be doing this for a
long time for that to be a significant
source of revenue yeah yeah that makes
sense i feel like the uh i again i find
out different things about the industry
at different times based on the arc of
me making videos
and it was kind of the opposite like
it was just adsense for like the first
eight years and i didn't spend that much
that was fine but then i had to learn
the building the business part
afterwards right to just to structure it
in a way that it was much more reliable
and steady and i didn't have to depend
on whatever
cpm it was that month right um but it's
valuable to learn that stuff like as
early as you can i feel like an another
complaint we hear sometimes is that
youtube is not serving my videos to my
subscribers i find that uh kind of a cop
out yeah yeah i agree yeah i i hear a
lot of like
and it's kind of comes back to what you
said like the title and the if you're
scrambling for the title and thumbnail
and like why isn't it being served
there's probably a reason before youtube
makes that decision that has affected
whether it's being served or not and
also it's probably being served it's
just not being clicked on yes it is
being served yeah it's just not being
clicked on yeah all right we'll be right

onedream.com waveform now back to colin
samir
there is one thing that i think we would
like to come back that would help us a
lot and that's and i get why they took
it away but annotations coming back for
us would be huge i mean ultimately being
able to re-upload a video in the same
position would be the best but i also
kind of understand why you know you
don't put that in but the amount of
times we make these like very very small
mistakes that
don't change the video at all like we
say
the new iphone has titanium rails
instead of aluminum rails and the amount
of people that call us out for stuff
like that we could just toss an
annotation in there like good for
engagement though yeah
yeah that is true
yeah it just gets to this point where
like i'd love to just put a little like
astrix like we meant the snapdragon 88
not the 887 or something like that yeah
i think in the tech world that
specifically it would be so useful like
product names are eight
eight words long and you have to get
every single one right and specs are
very very long and very detailed numbers
and you just want to be able to just
add a little asterisk inside a video and
when there is one the best i can do is
pin a comment in the top of the
description but there's no way to just
or just tweet about it annotations but
that's not on youtube so it doesn't
really help i don't get why a partner
like having partners like getting
annotations i remember the days of you
know like 12 annotations or a full
screen clear one so when you click on it
it brings you to a link
get rid of that but yeah partners with
annotations feel like it would make
sense i do think that
in in a
tech review like purposefully sometimes
not not not the tech itself but even
like fumbling or saying a word that's
completely off at times like would
create a lot of like
you know retention of like wait what did
he just say yeah
we did it one time in a short which was
really fun
yeah we said
we had we said the head of robert kinsel
youtube yeah like we should have said
the head of youtube robert kinsel
said this and we said that robert
kennedy has tripled yeah yeah yes
that's funny i think some people ass
we'll say that's why we're doing it yeah
i think people are saying that that's
what's happening when it really it's
like we just went from reviewing a phone
to reviewing a camera to reviewing a car
to reviewing a tablet right so like i
forgot that it's the triple eight not
bad right um so annotations i'll put in
an anyway if anyone on youtube is
watching this annotation we'll take it
we'll test it for you yeah i also think
we're going to see video replies make a
comeback really i liked video responses
because now that they have youtube
shorts oh yeah that's really interesting
that so they could tie in so yeah people
would reply to videos with
and that would create more creators
because there's this whole ecosystem
where even people like us we talk about
youtube creators so you could just go
into the comments drop a short video
yeah and start building an audience
that was a really big part i mean you
see the way tick tock does it now where
videos are embedded in comments but like
that was a that was a whole youtube
ecosystem thing there were reply
channels yeah and under any video you
could either
so if i was the creator i could enable
anyone to submit a video reply and
they'd all just show up but then people
started spamming them or people would
just like spam replies or whatever so
you could only approve
uh you could set it to approve only and
then approve whichever ones you wanted
and so you would often find that the
biggest creators would always approve
replies from the same creators
and then those creators who were just
replying to people would have their own
ecosystem because of the people they
replied to which is fascinating and i
really like the idea of bringing shorts
back as video reply or bringing video
replies back as shorts because if we
made a video about you
yeah and then we approved you to be able
to make a video supply if we got
something wrong or if you wanted to add
something yeah yeah and then it's on my
channel so people link to what i just
made a video about interesting that's
actually really good it's honestly the
best idea i've heard for shorts yeah
actually i'd love to talk to you guys
about shorts to do them we've been
pretty um
negative about them maybe i mean or
we've been vocal about them i'll say but
we don't really do them they're very
against not against but they're not like
our right back they're very different
they're definitely not our original
content and that's like on the main
channel the number one thing we know is
like we have
a format
and we're sticking with it and we love
it so obviously a 40-second video
doesn't fit in that form a vertical 40
second video in the same feed as our
regular videos it feels off yeah but you
guys have you've done shorts on the main
channel you guys have experimented with
shorts in the past do you how would you
summarize first of all your experience
with youtube shorts because i've had
i've heard a variety of versions of
responses
very positive yes
generally positive i would say that for
us
you know we had um
we had a creator on our show who goes by
nas daily and he said something to us
about platforms which is really
interesting around like just the the
concept of supply and demand there are
some platforms that have enough supply
of content and enough demand they've
reached equilibrium there's 50 000
pieces of videos uploaded per day and
500 million viewers per day like that's
average of 10 views per video or
whatever that's equilibrium platforms
there are platforms that don't have
equilibrium
right where they have incredible demand
for views
not enough supply for content that is
the place you want to be in and that's
why creators have such big opportunity
uh because the platform wants
that content they want to experiment
with it they want to try it yeah
but on the other side of it for us what
we notice is it takes us a really long
time to make a video
but we have a lot of thoughts like we
have quick takes that we want to get out
and yes there's you know there's a vlog
or like just pop open the camera and
start talking but then they're still
editing and like there's just so much
and i think vertical short form content
lowered our barrier to entry to just
have like some forgiveness around it and
be like it's okay it's just a vertical
video yeah and we shoot it straight
through the phone and we do some editing
but
it is this first opportunity for us in a
long time to film something and get it
out on our youtube channel in the same
day so if something happens we can react
to it yeah and
from our conversations with people at
youtube
the you know the the shorts feed and the
main channel feed like short form videos
and long form videos are kind of
bifurcated in the back end and so it's
not it's not one in the same it's not
like
you know they know it's a different type
of video it's not gonna bring your
average view duration down yeah
so for us we were like okay if there's
no real big risk to the channel yeah
why not like why not try them and
from what we've seen is
you know
in the past 28 days and we've done
around like 25 million views on the
channel and there's like i think above
60 of that is coming from shorts
and um
that has just generally made our entire
catalog of content
uh generate more viewership because
there's just more traffic to our channel
right and so if you think about it as
like a retail shop like our channels
like a retail shop we've just increased
our traffic significantly
and when that happens then they're going
to look at other stuff in our shop too
right and so they're going to look at
our back catalog they're gonna look at
all of our and and our subscribers have
grown our just overall brand exposure
has has grown because i'm short so i
mean one of our shorts has 15 million
views and that converted about 16 or 17
000 subscribers wow okay and the value
prop in the short is you know explaining
things that are happening on youtube and
in media so if someone likes that and
that's their first entrance to us yeah
makes a lot of sense i mean i so my
experience
has just been watching other people
experiment with shorts and so i've seen
people try it on the main channel i
think i probably will eventually start a
channel just to experiment with shorts
because i have a lot of ideas that i
think would be good shorts that channel
should be called mkb
shorts just
[Music]
but but also like what the studio to me
feels like
a space to experiment like why not
experiment yeah with shorts on the
studio channel true and especially for
me i look at it as like
right now again that like the demand is
high and the supply is just catching up
right that's what i was saying so
like there's gonna be a moment where
that swaps viewership's gonna change
it's gonna they're gonna they're gonna
test and iterate and test and iterate
and there's just a moment right now
where
they're just serving everyone the same
small amount of charts yeah or just like
at least from what we've seen we've seen
creators who have just taken shorts and
grown to six million subs there's a
creator called dental digest have you
seen him no he's like a dental creator
and every short form video is is
very similar it's it's like one format
where he tests different brushes and
sees how well they brush his teeth he's
a dental student he grew from zero to
six million subs this year um that's why
all through shorts and now he's making
long-form content right and it's
trending and it's doing well yeah one of
his one of his longer form videos was
number one on trending and so he
basically used shorts to build a
platform
i think the thing that's dangerous is if
the shorts have a completely different
function than the long-form video right
it has to all fall in the same value
prop and if it does then
why not i think it's youtube's play to
get creators from tick tock over to
youtube
as you're saying it makes perfect sense
because i i've heard from multiple
different people you know tick-tock
creators are getting huge but ultimately
even the biggest tick-tockers want to be
youtubers
but converting that from a whole
different app is is hard so if you're in
the app already and you can just be on
the same channel and there's the
long-form contact that they now
converted for that's perfect they just
took away the barrier to entry which was
really high now you can literally just
repurpose a lot of your tick tocks yeah
download them take the logo off upload
them to youtube shorts
and you could have if you've been on
tiktok for the last three years you
could have years worth of valuable
content ready to go also though
you don't have to upload a thumbnail for
shorts i mean we just don't even do it
you don't have to but you can you can
yeah so if you go to our like videos tab
it's not very aesthetic anymore right
it's like
it is just
these like vertical shorts mixed in with
like our edited thumbnails so that is
not very aesthetic but the fact that
it's just playing in a you know auto
play yeah so you know you're not really
thinking about getting the thumbnail and
the shorts you're not thinking about the
packaging because actually the audience
isn't even choosing to watch it the app
is choosing the audience and so it's
like the inverse of the traditional
youtube video and i think for that it's
really interesting and i think youtube
the thing that youtube has from an
opportunity perspective is that tik tok
like you mentioned a lot of tick tock
creators are coming over to youtube to
like graduate for their career right and
we've heard the classic you know
comparison on twitter all the time of
like would you rather have 50 000
youtube subscribers or 5 million tick
tock followers and almost
it's like so amazing that it always
trends towards 50 000 youtube
subscribers just because you can make a
career on youtube
so i think this is the play to say hey
we are the we are youtube we are the
better
place to launch your career
so we'll have these short form videos
too and so if you were thinking about
tick tock just do it over here because
then you're already building that
foundation like dental digest where it's
like now you have six million
subscribers now you have a career it's
youtube yeah already there you're
already there yeah i think that one
point you brought up about supply and
demand is really interesting the the
when i see new features get launched
especially by youtube but kind of by any
social network i always really like
diving into how much it looks like
they've embraced this new feature does
it look like they're just kind of trying
it on the side or does it look like they
are building
part of their site around it
and to me shorts does look like youtube
is like committing really hard to making
sure it's a big thing
sometimes i see features where like you
know for example there's podcasts on
facebook or like there's a video podcast
on spotify and i don't really see that
many of them and i kind of wonder how
committed they are because i see the
feature ad but i don't want to pivot my
whole business around something that
might disappear in a year
so i am glad to see shorts get the
attention that i think that it's rightly
deserving and i'm i'm definitely going
to want to experiment with a little bit
you know those restaurants and strip
malls that say like we have these in la
i don't know if you guys have these here
it says like chinese food and donuts
that sounds amazing but
i want one yeah i see where you're going
okay all right you see where i'm going
but basically like for me personally
i want to go to a chinese restaurant for
chinese food i want to go to a donut
shop for donuts
so when i think about apps that are
trying to do a lot i think that like it
overwhelms me i'm like are you are you a
specialist in this is this the thing you
make are you trying to serve me chinese
food and donuts at the same time yeah
because you saw an opportunity so i
think for me as a consumer i i i'm so
specific like i listen to podcasts on
spotify i watch video on youtube i might
also be the old guy who's just like
doesn't want to change my ways i worry
about that but
but that's just who i am uh and i think
a lot of consumers are like that too
where it's simplicity wins a lot and
singular focus wins a lot of the time so
yeah youtube was based in short form
video when we first started in 2011 we
were uploading 20 second videos to
youtube because that's where short form
video lived there's no instagram video
there was no there's no tick tocks
there's no vine at the time so short
form video lived on youtube so i think
they actually do have an expertise in it
where they can
solve how to serve you videos and then
their video monetization is better than
other platforms so they will also solve
down the line how those are monetized i
think it's only a matter of time until
you know you open up the instagram app
and you're just in reals and potentially
even with youtube as well
because it's an extra step that keeps
you away from a view keeps you away from
creator discovery right i could totally
see youtube doing that with the with the
mobile app yeah netflix is also doing it
too you notice that the network the
netflix mobile app has a tick tock
feature oh gosh where you're swiping
through
moments of shows because you can't
upload yourself no but it's like it's
like funny moments from their shows that
are it's the exact same ui it's called
fast laughs it's just for the college
comedy yeah that makes sense i mean
netflix is serving that's their job is
to find stuff for you
their like smart tv app is like you
can't accidentally just take your hand
off the controller for a second because
it starts playing the trailer the second
yeah hover over everything which is very
annoying but obviously extremely
extremely successful that's a good point
it's basically already auto play yep
it's just starting to play already
i've found that my our videos have
slowly gotten longer like you said you
started with shorter videos even on our
channel
i think the the first couple of years of
videos i was making were all like
three to five minutes long and they were
the same genre but they were all three
to five minutes because that's all i
needed to tell the story or just say how
good the thing was
today a short video is like seven
minutes long and i've uploaded 15 25 35
minute long videos
so part of that is definitely that i
feel like it's taken me longer to finish
all of my thoughts on a piece of tech
and i generally i just want to make
longer videos i think that's valid but
the other half is that at a certain
point youtube started favoring longer
videos and so i felt like a little bit
of it was leaning into the algorithm of
like hey well that's more watch time too
so longer videos is fine
how much do you find it to be
problematic or maybe even beneficial to
bend your content to the algorithm
because i know that's something
some people just don't want to do ever
and that's something entire channels
sometimes are based around so i'm
curious your thoughts on that so we'd
describe you know this term content
market fit
as a dance between three things one is
what you want to make it still has to be
what you want to make you have to want
to make this video and enjoy making the
video the second is there has to be an
audience for that
you have to be plugging into
you know an audience or you have to be
aware that you're going to create an
audience but there has to be an audience
for what you're making and then the the
third thing is the algorithm so i think
all three actually have to play together
what you want to make what your audience
wants to watch and then what the
algorithm wants to feed
and
i think that
you have to have all three check
a lot of times you know when we're
thinking about packaging like we are
thinking about
the algorithm but there's some times
where we have an idea and we think about
really good packaging for it and then
we're like uh i don't want to i don't
want to make that video like that's not
that's not us yeah um
and so i think all three have to be
clicked on for it to work
and for you to enjoy it um because i
think audience there's too much content
now where if you're just doing it for
the algorithm i think an audience can
feel that you can sniff that out yeah
pretty easily like you you've probably
i've watched videos where i'm just like
oh this is kind of like
you're almost watching like a game like
someone game the algorithm or like
someone you know create like a it's like
when you watch someone like uh like the
last three pages of an essay or just to
reach the minimum threshold yeah just
spewing words yeah like i can tell what
you're trying to do i get what's
happening here yeah yeah and so
yeah i mean when i think about it like i
don't think i personally watch content
on youtube that's good for the algorithm
i like to watch really long form
podcasts
which probably don't have amazing
retention
i love to watch loose vlogs like the
type of content that i like to watch
you know yeah but when it comes to
length though there's also as a creator
and intangible question you have to ask
yourself which is is this
interesting yeah what our audience find
is interesting and that determines the
length of our video if we have a two
hour conversation with a creator and if
by chance only 15 minutes we actually
found interesting and we asked everyone
in our office did you find this
interesting that's going to be a 15
minute video yeah right but if we went
for two hours and it was all interesting
and we asked everyone again in our in
our office listen to this watch it was
it interesting then that's what goes up
i mean two of the three things i
mentioned though are like from a
distribution mindset one is what does
the audience want and one is what is the
what does the platform want uh okay
right and so those are like distribution
mindsets so two thirds of your brain is
distribution
the third is creation which is what do i
want to make
and when you look at at least for me
when i look back at the last four years
we've been we have we've had the collins
mirror channel for four years and we
made no money doing colin and sameer for
three years of that right or or maybe
it's now five years and it was three
years of not working in the two years of
working and a lot of that has been that
shift when i look back at the older
videos i'm like oh we were creators we
didn't want to cut out stuff
that actually was uninteresting but we
liked it because we were like that was a
cool shot or that was a good thing that
was a fun line we said let's keep it in
and then today when we all watch cuts
together we're watching as a group and
we are ruthless we're like
that was boring cut it that was
uninteresting cut it that was
interesting but not interesting enough
we're gonna make it a short cut it yeah
like we are constantly cutting because
we're thinking about the two-thirds
which is algorithm and audience yeah um
this is this is why i like i
struggle to apply it to a tech video
because if i cut out
genuinely useful information because it
was boring
i'm not left with a complete video
anymore yeah and a lot of what i want to
deliver is the best most informative
thing and i have to drag you from one
exciting thing to the other but also
make sure i include all the other things
in between about how all this bent this
higher bandwidth memory is much better
for performance while i get to sharing
how much faster it was in final cut
exports like the exciting thing to me
is
surrounded by other
necessary but less youtube exciting
things so i think i've never heard it
described that way but i do feel like i
am doing that balancing act in my head
every time i'm editing is like making
sure i include the things but also
making sure i quickly get you to the
next
like highlight
while
making sure i include all the things
that need to be included i want to be
careful when i give you feedback here
because what you're doing is working so
i'm not gonna
i have not reached the you know we have
not we've never really made a tech video
i'm not immune to feedback okay but i
think when you have the opportunities to
and when you've done it on your channel
to show and not tell that's when things
get really interesting because it's a
very visual medium so if it's about like
the processing speed can you show me
something can you shoot something in 8k
and like bring it into the computer and
show me how quick that happens while
you're telling me about something else
you're like i'm going to load this up
and then i'm going to tell you about the
next thing but in the background of the
video or in a second split screen i'm
tracking how quickly yeah something's
moving right so then it's like two
things are happening at once and you're
showing me speed while you're saying
something different and i'm all of a
sudden i'm tracking multiple narratives
and that keeps me on the edge of my seat
yeah uh and i think when the times when
you do that i think that's like the
opportunity with tech is to show as much
as possible yeah i've played with that a
little bit i've played i've definitely
played with like how much people respond
to what's being said versus what's being
shown yeah and
again it depends on what the video is
but i keep coming back to your views
people really linger on what's being
said
more so sometimes than what's being
shown unless they contradict yeah so a
lot of times i talk about smooth
performance and i talk about how this is
zippy and fast and i'm showing that too
but sometimes i'll say something is
smooth and i'll show a clip of it
behaving perfectly normally and people
are like why do you say it's smooth it
looks totally normal well i'm telling
you it's smooth because i can't show
this as well as i need to i can show a
performance hiccup but it's hard to show
you the smoothness so there's little
bits of pieces of tech that are
i just have to say it yeah like to tell
you what's happening
so i think
i mean granted this is for me who's not
like if a lot of stuff you say on your
channel i'm like i i don't know what
you're saying exactly but i like what
i'm seeing uh so i'm more of the visual
guy for your in your audience but i
think also analogy is really helpful
like analog like you're drawing
something those those are the types of
things that for me i need to be like
tech explained to me like i'm
probably not five five-year-olds are
pretty smart now so i don't know it's
like zach explained to me like i know
nothing about tech
we have done some small things like that
um when hole punch cutouts for the front
of uh cell phones were first coming out
we there was a point where
it's hard to explain to someone who's
never seen it that like it kind of you
don't notice it after a while of using
it so what you did was as you were
speaking in the a-roll you put a black
circle on the screen and then like 20
seconds later it was like by the way
this has been here the whole time did
you notice it didn't you that's great if
you didn't look you probably aren't
going to notice this stuff like that but
i do think it's a it's an interesting
thought of like performance or even like
charging speeds or something like that
to maybe have some sort of a a ticker on
the side i mean we we kind of did it
with a thousand mile race where michael
did our whole map thing so when we're
talking about different things the map
is showing what's happening yeah that's
cool um and michael's obviously a wizard
so being able to pull stuff like that
off would be pretty easy yeah that was
something jimmy said to us actually just
to go back to
what he was saying when he was
explaining to us like
multiple stories he was saying to us he
was like well
you know what you guys are saying is one
story but your b-roll is another story
right and so it's actually not
necessarily thinking
like all about yeah one line of like
what you're saying but like your
animations are another story and so the
the
viewer is tracking the different
information they're receiving as all
stories right and if they all tell the
exact same story like in a very didactic
way then it's it might not be as
engaging but if they're doing it in very
different ways then
yeah that's interesting i feel like
that's something i've played around with
a little bit more because in a tech
video i keep going back to reviews yeah
but like
yeah most of what i'm saying it helps if
you can see it too so as i'm saying each
thing and this is how most reviews are
it'll cut to showing the thing
everything every sentence has a
five-second clip to show what's being
said show it being said show it's being
said show is being said and there are
some parts of some tech videos where
it's a little bit more storytelling and
it's a little bit more it's a little
less
show something and a little bit more
like telling a story of a gadget or
maybe i've really enjoyed using this
thing or things that you don't really
have a direct clip for and that's when
in the edit i'm starting to play a
little more with visuals that show other
things
um
but i want to find more of those because
i think your guys's b-roll is a story
though like yeah our office when you
guys upload a new video like they'll go
nuts over one shot or one animation
waiting to see which shot is going to
come yeah i remember even like the
studio uh intro animation was like a
two-hour conversation in our office of
like
so i think you guys do have that that
narrative is a lot of like your b-roll
like you mentioned you showed us the
robot in here it's like when you use
that those six seconds
that's a whole story that i'm waiting
for i'm waiting to see how that plays
out or what's the next shot what's the
next shot yeah there was also one video
where you had and maybe it was multiple
videos but where there was a second
angle and every once in a while you
would turn oh yeah and speak to that
other end that was really good and even
that was a retention strategy as a
audience member i was waiting for you
to do that next cut in was that dogecoin
i think so this is not financial events
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and that's the
video that reminds me a lot of like john
stewart uh or some of those
satire comedy shows where the
information is really dense yeah and
they break it with a joke
right every 30 40 seconds they break up
really dense information with a joke it
kind of reminded me of that and that's
what gets you through it yeah yeah
that's sort of something i talked about
in the skillshare class it was like i
like to have a common thread that goes
through the entire video if i can or but
at least over multiple sections of the
video
but it's hard to keep somebody
focused with all that information for a
long time so you do kind of need to find
ways to have like beats or like
bring people from point to point and
there's a bunch of different ways to do
that and that was one of that was a fun
one i did like the dojo
video for that reason but
yeah that is uh that is that was a fun
one i want to ask you about youtube
comments
because we briefly talked about this
earlier about how maybe it's not the
best place to hang out in the comments
section on youtube
but
one of my notorious
i think i've said this more often than
any other piece of youtube advice is
the best comments i get are from people
who have never seen any of the videos
before
and those aren't on youtube those are on
like reddit or like a random website
that embeds a video for the first time
and like the audience for that website
will be like oh this is a good video for
this reason those are the most
informative interesting comments that
and that inform how i can improve and
how i can make videos better do you hang
out in the youtube comments section at
all do you hang out on reddit on discord
what do you how do you get feedback from
your audience and what do you think is
the most valuable
i'm pretty plugged into the comments but
um
i wouldn't i would say there's like
always four in a month that are like
really good feedback
just like there's a few and then like
i'll screenshot it and send it to colin
and we'll like talk about it and there's
there's only youtube comments yeah
there's only like a few yeah and it'll
be something about like
hey guys that one part was unnecessary i
got bored during this part and it kind
of irks you because you're like because
like i agree with you
yeah yeah it's the worst one it's true
but yeah i think that type of stuff or
like when someone's like why did you
make this video like if there's some
like
more
comments around like our entire brand
like is this on brand for us so there's
some that are from like people who are
watching video to video the worst is
where it's like hey guys i typically
love your videos but you know and you're
like oh god
it's worse when you let down someone
who's like a fan yeah and then there's
also the people who come in they're like
wow i hate these guys or like these guys
but at that time it probably means we
made a video that a lot of people are
watching if like the hate really starts
pouring in which doesn't happen to us
that like in that like crazy to a crazy
degree but
yeah there's a bit of it where we talk a
lot where if it gets beyond our audience
and we start receiving some of those
comments of like negativity then we know
that the video was good enough to get
beyond our audience and so we're like
and
i think you know you're making something
that is of value and that has its own
perspective if people disagree with it
or dislike it
if you're you know appealing to everyone
you're very much like in your bubble and
so i think that the comments indicate to
us not only like certain feedback from
our community but also you know when we
do make something that allows us to grow
the brand yeah when there's negativity
and
i will say that i want a more
tight-knit group
where we can have
more actual feedback from our audience
and that might play out over over
discord uh in the future it might play
out in other places but i would say that
like
we've also built a culture internally in
our office of of a lot of feedback and i
think that's been really beneficial
because there's a lot of times where
colin and i have an idea and we're
excited about it we tell the team and
actually happened recently and they were
like
no
we don't think that should be a video
that's made on this channel and we think
it should be this one and we went with
the team's advice and it was one of our
most popular videos and so we were like
oh wow
like it's so helpful to surround
yourself with people who
deeply care but also really understand
the brand that you're building so that
the feedback
is beyond just us too yeah the diversity
of thought yeah yeah yeah do you ever
look at like other random places outside
of the comments section where you might
find video feedback like if a video is
embedded somewhere and you see like
traffic from a new audience i'm
terrified by reddit um i just think i'm
always there yeah i think i'm always
gonna get like kicked off or like i feel
like an imposter on reddit like i feel
like i'm not cool enough on the internet
to be there um so i do sometimes search
our name on reddit
and
look at some of the conversation and i
find that to be really interesting
because people who are on reddit are the
ones who are
really engaged the most positive
negative even if someone like says
something like oh yeah like you know
colin and smeared to this and someone's
like who i think that's interesting too
where it's like oh wow okay like i don't
know i just i find reddit to be
interesting to search your name on yeah
because i also think it's a validation
point that if people are talking about
you on reddit then there's you're at
you're at least a part of the internet
culture yeah you contributed to
something that people find useful and
they're sharing it amongst themselves
yeah which is a good start and then you
get feedback from that i feel like
reddit was a ahead of its time uh and
it's it's still around but i feel like
youtube could have made a reddit like
comment section
like that would have been really amazing
if youtube had made reddit or even like
a community
chat that that could like the mkbhd
community could live within a google or
youtube ecosystem it feels like reddit
and discord and youtube need to have a
meeting yeah
the best feedback we've ever seen
because it's like you know you can post
a really nice well thought out comment
and then because of their organization
you can have a really great conversation
under that and very quickly pick what
that is but man they also know how to
leave some very yeah negative hurtful
stuff and yeah it's rough to go through
sometimes yeah if you had any feedback
now this is for
your audience members maybe they want to
provide feedback you said you've seen
maybe four good comments that you really
thought was good feedback and there's
somebody out there who's a fan of you
and maybe wants to suggest something
what would be the best way to get the
attention because
it feels like there's a lot of comments
that i've responded to that seem super
negative and i've gotten like in a tizzy
about it responded and then i realized
they didn't mean any harm yeah they were
actually just
sometimes it's hard through text it
tends to get off so i think two things
one the the absolute way to not get our
attention i'm sure you experienced this
too is to write us like a essay of an
email yep yeah just
i can tell from the first sentence of
the email what's going to happen yeah
and like just just imagine us opening it
on our on our mobile device and then
scrolling nine times like there's no way
we're going to read it we get so many of
those
on on the contrary like there's very
limited amounts but people who make
videos about our videos i just consume
information through
video that's just how i like to probably
the fastest but the hardest way to get
our attention yeah the best way someone
has ever gotten our attention is they
venmoed me a dollar
and then wrote their tip
like in the description
yeah they wrote their message in the
description of the payment because i was
like
why did i just get a dollar and then i
looked and then i read and it was like
hey smear i found you on venmo and i was
like wow that is that's unique and it
was like video feedback no it wasn't
video feedback it was actually like
wanting to collaborate on a project oh
wow and we ended up doing it the guy
wanted us to on his podcast i was gonna
say like hey if you have video feedback
for us
we take feedback in the form of ten
dollars
we won't listen your feedback unless you
donate yeah right no that's that's
really interesting yeah i think i mean
i'm on twitter all the time i see a lot
of yeah it's become also though you have
to be careful about um what you address
because if all you ever do is respond to
negative feedback then people see that
and they figure the way to get your
attention
here's some negative feedback so it's a
it's a healthy mix of like reading
understanding maybe if it's a genuine
question you can engage and go back and
forth with people and you'll get some
actually good advice and things like
that um but you have to be careful you
have to be careful do you guys ever get
feedback from fellow tech creators or
creator friends not enough i think
that's that's one thing also jimmy was
talking about like we we should network
better with fellow tech creators i've
been friends with some of these guys for
literally a decade and it's like we grew
up together and now these guys have kids
and i'm like oh my god we've been making
this stuff for so long that we've grown
up
and yeah no we should have more inner
dialogue we should have like we have we
made a discord server a while ago and
then it died and then it's overwhelming
like i think even right now the amount
of
chats that i'm a part of i can't i just
can't i can't i can't stay on top of it
all yeah yeah i can't but it's all it's
all useful like it's all genuine like
there's i'm in several discords i'm in
like a couple slack groups and like
random group chats on whatsapp and stuff
and i'm like all of this is great
information i'm just like
if i if i sit here processing it all
i'll never make another video i'll just
be reading and replying to everyone
what's crazy is like i think the value
of internet community is at least for me
i find like 12 people to be my cap of
anything beyond that i start to lose
track of
what's happening you know and like even
in discord too i think you have to the
culture of discord is like you have to
have it up to be able to
to catch up with what's happening yeah
uh because otherwise behind yeah you
just fall behind and then you you feel
like uncomfortable contributing yeah
it's good advice i'm gonna i'm gonna try
to find my like t-mobile phase five yeah
exactly yeah yeah yeah it's a good idea
i feel like we get good feedback
generally when we see people in person
so ces is always like a great time where
we we love ces
lately the tech there is not that great
anymore but we get to see all the tech
friends that we know and like a lot of
them are on the west coast we're
obviously on the east coast the best
part being able to see everyone go out
and have dinner it just
it comes up in conversation
and
that's all great but you know covet now
and everything we've seen juddner we've
seen i haven't seen austin we haven't
seen linus like we haven't seen anyone
forever and it's a lot harder i think to
and maybe we should normalize it a bit
but just text someone or send them a
message be like yeah maybe this could be
done a little better because it probably
comes off as rude if you're just sending
a message out of the blue and offering
advice jimmy's not shy about that
i love that i've had a couple phone
calls with jimmy yeah i love that about
it so useful he's not shy about it yeah
i will say that our our designer and
editor chris is in a
thumbnail discord for people who work
with creators and design their
thumbnails and it's like a very niche
and very small group of people get tim
in there yeah yeah i i find it like when
i look when he tells us about it and
sometimes he'll hit our slack because
we'll post a video and then the other
designers in there will be like hey
maybe you guys should tweak it like this
and then he'll send us the the chat and
i'm like
yeah they discuss our thumbnail every
monday morning yeah and it's far better
we used to just put out thumbnails on
twitter and ask twitter what they
thought like was this i did enjoy that
to be honest which was yeah it was very
fun it was fun but the feedback was all
over the place from some people who like
we're like all right that's that's
pretty good feedback but you i don't
think i've ever made a thumbnail before
and yeah we also found one time we did
it yeah one time we did it and we were
going to put the video out like a week
later
and then another organization did that
thumbnail that everyone voted and put
the video out before we did
with the same title and we were like oh
okay we i don't know if we can do that
publicly because again like titles and
thumbnails are that valuable yeah
that especially for complex topics like
recovering sometimes that's interesting
so we stopped doing it after that yeah
because you don't want to share too
early do you find that you see uh other
channels
like copying things that you do
and do you do anything about it
um at times yes but we've also
been inspired by others you know and
like there's there's a difference yeah
for sure we've we've seen it
more across other projects now now that
we you know we have our newsletter the
published press we have
um
you know we we have what we're doing on
shorts we have you know what we're doing
in the in the on on the main channels
sometimes we see like a concept that we
say in the main channel and then we see
a tick tock that has 5 million views
with the same concept but someone just
kind of just posted yeah
yeah so we don't know um the newsletter
is more obvious
when it happens but there's only so much
information and i also think that what
i've learned especially in media
is oftentimes like you are as a media
organization you think of yourself as
like a i think of us as like sprinters
like we're sprinting
and
there's a lot of people who are gonna
start taking off right behind you as you
start going and that's natural because
they see something that's working and
they're like let's do that version or
our version of that
and if you ever start running it's
possible they'll sprint past you and so
my visual once people start
you know taking some of our concepts or
anything that's potentially inspired by
us is like okay so there's something's
working that we're doing because people
are thinking they could they want to do
something similar and so we just have to
keep on a sprint or we have to go in a
direction that they can't even
predict we're getting a robot yeah so
that's
basically
we just need a robot and just like don't
don't look behind you just be like all
right i just have to
get a bigger robot keep going forward
yeah i like that i like that all right
so i promised i would ask you guys this
okay okay um you've talked to so many
creators and you've
you've sort of analyzed
the
behavior of so many creators that i'm
curious if you were to
roast me create critique my channel and
don't be shy about it because like
you're saying like oh something must be
working yeah things are working but like
we're all
pretty much experimenting with
a large majority of the things we're
doing and we're willing to take that
feedback i would love to like when you
guys watch our videos what do you like
pausing the video and saying you know
what they could have done better here or
are you saying like their thumbnails
should be better or something like that
what do you guys talk about with our
channel and could do all channels too
waveform waveform clips studio like the
whole shebang because i mean three of
those are fairly new to us and there
obviously could use more work those ones
aren't at the level the main channel is
so everything could use work and the
most people we talk to are tech
youtubers so it's nice to have an
outside perspective on things who you've
seen everything you could imagine yeah
so a couple questions before we get into
this yes
first of all how do you define the
audience for the mkbhd channel like
because i fit into a certain audience
category but i'm curious how do you
define the lion's share of the audience
there
well i do i have two buckets i have one
which is the
the subscriber who is watching the
videos for entertainment value and is
somewhat into tech and i have two which
is the person who is searching for the
device and is making a purchase decision
and usually the lion's share at the
beginning is type one
and then over time seo takes over and a
lot more people watch the video making a
purse decision
and that's type 2 later
and it depends on what the video is a
lot of times if it's not about a gadget
it's more type 1 here for entertainment
tech related but a lot of times it's a
video that is just about a gadget not
many people care about and the type 1
audience is very small and it's a 9 or
10 out of 10 and then over time seo
takes over and it does much better
because it's an interesting or popular
device for headphones or something like
that but it's generally those two
buckets for me
so here's what i would say i'm i'm
watching for more
like edutainment right like i'm looking
to get educated i like to be i'm not
necessarily like an early adopter
i'm not watching to potentially purchase
tech yeah i'm watching because i'm
getting educated on what's happening so
i don't get left behind in the world of
of innovation and then also for
entertainment purposes
one of my favorite videos and i think
both of us why we were able to cite like
even your head turn in it was when you
started talking about dojo or when you
talked about dogecoin um and i think it
was something that was like tech
adjacent
that was in the zeitgeist that was
really interesting so what i would say
is like
uh getting a little bit more comfortable
outside of your typical topics and
thinking about starting to step into
what's tech adjacent yeah i think is
would be really interesting teslabot
explained was great yeah basically the
majority of your explained series and
thinking about like how can i apply the
mkbhd format and style to things that
you know more people are are interested
in is it like the tech behind certain
you know movies or shows is it like
you know like squid game for example
squid game is a massive topic what's the
mkbhd video on squid game is there one
right or is that really out of line and
so that's what i would say is that i
think there's an opportunity to not
necessarily cut out
like like broaden the niche too much but
to step into more zeitgeisty topics that
are
you know taking over is it like
you know the audio waveforms behind old
town road like why does that sound
you know
hit us in a certain way why are we
receiving
this audio waveform in a way that's
taking over the world i think that's the
type of stuff that i would want to start
to turn to you for and be really
interested in and maybe that starts at
shorts on the studio channel or
something right i'm i'm really glad you
said that because part of my struggle
every year and i sort of explained to
you like the way i divide up the year of
like first half is trying new things
second half is like gadget gadgey gadget
every time i try
a new
topic or like stepping a little outside
of what's typically like a gadget video
i'm always the back of my head is always
nervous about like no one's gonna want
my opinion on this or no one's gonna
really care like people are here for
like i can very quickly associate the
best performing videos typically with
the most
interesting gadgets yeah and so if it's
not one of those interesting gadgets why
would anyone care about my video
and then i make the video and inevitably
it does really well right and it
it it always hits me as a surprise every
time
but like that video you mentioned or
even like the youtube rewind video i did
or random videos about like the teslabot
or things that are adjacent
i always have that concern and i i
wonder where the line is about like how
far out is out of bounds because i have
interests that are all over the place
um but i like that i'd also i would be
really interested to see you
react to
certain things like how other people are
maybe it's like hollywood vfx maybe it's
like
you know this other like you're really
into video making as well yeah and so i
would be really interested like peter
mckinnon does a series like that i love
his series right that series is really
fun to watch where he reacts to like
hollywood vfx um i'd be really
interested to see you do some of that
like and and you can dial it into like
tech related so is it like
you know and this could be on the studio
channel but like reacting to
robotic camera movements
yeah i would be really interested in
watching you do that because i like
content and this is across everything i
like content that has those like double
narratives where
instead of finding those robotic camera
movement videos on instagram myself i'd
rather watch them through
your perspective
where i'm watching them and discovering
that content for the first time plus i'm
hearing your thoughts on it and i think
that in a world where we are so
inundated with like the for you page and
with instagram and like all these
algorithms are feeding us content i
think we want our favorite personality
or a trusted source to curate the
internet for us
and so i think finding like what's
happening on the internet that's
adjacent to what i talk about and how do
i put my spin on it and dogecoin was one
of those things it was just one of those
it was one of those things i think
there's more of those things yeah um and
then the overarching
i think like to keep
you know someone's attention again it's
what i said earlier it's i think it's
like the opportunities to
show not tell to say like you know when
you're if you're reviewing the rivian
uh during the process are you trying to
make it to the other side of the city
while someone else is trying to make it
there in a tesla
during the same while you're reviewing
the car right so two things are
happening at once i'm tracking a map oh
yeah you know that stuff i love those
ideas and then the logistics of actually
yeah shooting them i guess yeah so i
mean we had the car for 24 hours so
that's an extreme example but
i i do think like the dual narrative
type thing yeah would be fun to play
with more especially in like the classic
gadget review because
it's there's there's lots of
opportunities for it lots of gadget
reviews are pretty
straightforward you know what's coming
you know i'm going to get to the specs
you know i'm going to get the design you
don't wanna get to the battery life i'm
gonna get to the camera and then we're
gonna close it out like
let's let's have a little more fun with
it you also mentioned fitness tech with
chris paul as like a dream collab when
we talked yeah i think fitness tech
though just with you would be
interesting
yeah like i would be interested in other
versions of tech i'm terrified of
crossing those lines but i might have to
eventually i mean the tech in the
fitness world is cut with tempo and
tonal and peloton and everything now
it's really blowing up and it does make
a lot of sense yeah yeah but you also
have the studio channel to like test
these formats which is amazing i think
yeah i think we we also have a little
more of that flexibility to play with
new formats and ideas and things like
that on the studio channel and i think
that's what we will be doing in the next
year or so is just like hey i wonder
how well shorts will work i wonder if we
can we can do a storytelling type of
thing i mean we did a thousand mile road
trip but we'll have more things like
that coming up that'll be fun to play
with um i was saying i was i'm afraid of
crossing those lines because the the
fitness world
and the the ultimate tournaments and
everything are like
my offline time
and i
i i unplugged so hard for like two
straight days when i go to tournament
and i i know that the second i connect
those i can never unconnect them again
and i'm like all right do i really want
to start doing fitness tech videos
because then that's i'm plugged in
forever i can't unplug i don't know
maybe that's just me
yeah i get it i mean it's interesting
how much i think
fear is attached to youtube like as a
creator like so much so much of your
decision making is based on like this
this fear of
you know is that it's because is that
part of my identity or am i stretching
but i think it's because those that
two-thirds of what we talked about with
the with your content market fit where
it's like the algorithm and the audience
or two-thirds of your decision making so
yeah you know it's not necessarily it's
only a third of what you want to make
yeah
all right well i have uh i have one more
question
how fast can you type the alphabet
do you happen to know off the top of
your head
i do not know okay well actually we can
find out real quick uh do it do you have
the uh the keyboard please all right
here we go so we have a little game here
do you guys watch top gear at all or
have you ever seen it you know the the
race the recently placed car they kind
of all the guests they come on they put
them in this car and they race them
around the track and they keep a leader
so we kind of wanted a version of that
for the podcast where all our guests
were doing it we have a leaderboard um
and we have a little i could type
sentences faster than i could it is the
alphabet it's so much harder yeah um by
the way my palms are sweating that's
right now i'm terrified but i also
because we're prepared and a tech
that keyboard is terrible because it's a
macbook we have a chiclet style keyboard
or a mechanical one if you'd rather
dealer's choice but or
so we've got these i don't know what
you're more comfortable with but we want
to give everyone a fair shot to be uh
both our parents do the best we also
give three tries so it's not right we
both use this this yeah that's more
attention that's more interesting
because we've never used visually
interesting we both are on the same
playing fields because we've never used
a keyboard like this
wow i have like
seventh grade you forgot to do the
reading yeah and they just called on you
nerves the only thing we're a little
worried about is how easy it is to if
someone's a regular watcher all the time
and starts learning that this is what we
do to guess they'll practice but so far
everyone has been equally as nervous i
mean this is terrible so if i mess up do
i so just if you mess up it's not
deleted just get to the next one um
yeah we'll give three tries it basically
starts when you hit a and then we'll
reset it um no pressure and then at the
end we can
we'll pull up the leaderboard after
we're done and we can see where everyone
uh
all right here we go whatever you might
do it like this you don't i didn't home
run but you can you do everything it's
home row home like uh like just resting
your hands on the keyboard
like like you know you know that's
all right here we go
asmr mechanical keyboard
super accurate
that was it yeah what was your time 13
13. do i do it again i get one more you
can go one more yeah okay
i don't know why i'm nervous right now
i'm not gonna do anything
it's like being worried you're gonna get
called on next except you know you're
yeah like having to do a presentation
hoping they go too long so the this bell
rings and you're enough to do 10.
three seconds that's a huge try again
this is a great sounding keyboard uh
screen recording is going wow yes this
is do you want to know your place now or
do you want to wait no i want to wait if
i want to win i don't want to wait so
should i reset this yeah uh yeah just
don't mess up
oh my
gosh
oh my god
there we go
what what is this pace but he got to
watch me
oh my god
how'd he do
8.177 that's a pretty good first round
that's a wild first round i was going
through it in my head like
it's there's a couple scanners
i'll do one more all right
oh please
oh man this one i'm going to get in the
groove
six seconds nice yeah but i think it
it won't accidentally count one if like
you missed it or just wait till you
finally get it right so six point six
seven seven i mean you shave two seconds
off you you want to go for your third
thing yeah yeah yeah at this rate at
this rate this is frustrating for me
okay do i get a rebuttal or no uh
no we'll look all right
i should have gone second
oh you missed c by the way
all right that's over then yeah there it
is okay so it's my second one
that's pretty good you want to take his
third try do you want to you can take my
third drive then you'll go now you've
seen him do it
okay
if you get first place off of this one
there will be an asterisk but uh okay
i i don't think yeah okay i think i've
had too much coffee for this
yeah this is already a mess
oh i've missed this anyway okay i didn't
even yes i was gonna say if you're not
looking you can just totally miss yeah
it's gonna be nine seconds it's good
that's good all right all right well
we'll get that we'll get how about we'll
have the best number represent colin and
samir okay
uh let's see it's pretty good team score
would be what was it 6.8 we're looking
at
seventh place out of oh my god what is
first place fourteen four point four
three two four points who was that yeah
uh quinn from snazzy labs tech channel
i'm not sure if you guys are dude doug
demurrow's on here at 5.9 wow he did
pretty good yeah he also did it on his
lap like laying down on the couch yeah
so that was pretty amazing that's pretty
impressive we'll say that you know
you're not used to the the keyboard this
is that's what did it for me yeah that's
what it was if this was in a gmail and
on your laptop yeah
we appreciate the time and uh i'm glad
we got to have you guys in the studio in
person we're going to probably do these
more often but
thank you for for coming out here thank
you for spending the time if you guys
want to watch the video that they've
done on their channel
visiting the studio a little mini tour
little rapid fire 20 questions stuff
like that definitely check out their
channel we'll link it below but
obviously you want to watch their other
videos too so if that's not up by the
time this is up watch those
and i think that's pretty much it for
waveform this week thanks for watching
catch you guys next time see ya peace
