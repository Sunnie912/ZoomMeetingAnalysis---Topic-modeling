all right welcome back to another
episode of the waveform podcasts we're
your hosts i'm marquez and i'm andrew
and we've got a third host it's a
special format this time it's a game
show
uh is a little bit all over the place
it's kind of wild we've got
questions from different sources we've
got different answers we've also got
some q a
after everything so it's going to be a
fun one but
that's what waveform is all about in the
middle of summer buckle up so the format
for this game show is going to be
david hosting asking the questions me
versus andrew answering the questions uh
we both have an ipad here in front of us
david's got the host ipad so he can
start the countdown and we can literally
buzz in whoever buzzes in first we'll
get to answer
and then the questions themselves are
mostly about uh
tech from the first half of this year so
it's june we're right around the halfway
point of 2021 we've got a fair amount of
tech that's come out a fair amount of
videos and projects that we've worked on
and so that in theory is what the
questions are about
uh some of them are written by adam and
david some of them are actually written
by you guys
from the discord so we've we've pinged
you guys and asked you i have not
checked that channel of the discord yet
so you guys have been writing some
great game show questions i hear and
we'll try to answer them it's been
killing me because somebody like
pinged me in it but i refused to click
on the actual
channel so i don't see any of you i've
just had a notification sitting for like
24 hours and it's driving me insane i'm
glad you didn't check
i'm glad you didn't cheat that's good
all right that's what he says at least
yeah yeah
i guess uh i just wanna you you have all
the questions already
that you collected so computer may the
best uh trivia
buzzer win yeah i guess yeah
yeah a lot of these are definitely from
um the videos that we made
in the first half of 2021 all right i
really hope i get these then
okay or at least that i know them even
if i don't buzz first i hope i know them
all right adam you ready oh wait dude we
want
adam made adam made
correct and all right so do you want to
give us a little test example here adam
give us a a right answer sound
all right and give us a wrong answer
sound
okay all right that's it yeah i know
which one i want to hear
really insult to injury with that yeah
wrong answer
all right all right i think we're ready
ready yeah
okay question one
name one or all of the topics from the
first episode
of this year's waveform podcast
marquez is that at first yeah i buzzed
uh it's got to be ces we must have
talked about ces at some point during
january's first episode
no yeah we didn't talk about ces at all
because the first episode wasn't
gonna be yeah it's pre there wasn't
really a ces and it was pre
probably wednesday i think it was
because cs was like the six we skipped
the very
the very first friday was january 1st
and then the next friday still would
have been before when
quote-unquote ces comes out we didn't
even talk about the fact that i don't
think we even virtual
yeah my i get do i get a chance yeah you
gotta hit the buzzer though so i can get
you points
okay um
i think you i'm gonna guess that there
is a did you say i have to name all of
them or you can name
i'll give you points based on how many
you can i'm gonna guess there was a what
are you excited for
this year q a um
that's all i really have a guess for to
be honest
okay there's yeah that's
kinda wrong okay marquez do you want to
rebuttal no i
i don't remember okay i feel like i
should give you one point andrew because
it was smartphone rumors and predictions
which is kind of what are you excited
for
unless you don't i thought it was
specifically a q a though so so i won't
give you don't give me a point
i won't i won't take it it makes me so i
mean
what's kind of funny about that this is
our first year of doing or we just
started
weekly podcast stuff so it's way more
jumbled together than
it used to be yeah all right zero zero
okay yeah
zero out of the gates almost gates are
open
question wait what was the answer oh
right
all right the answer was actually 20 21
smartphone rumors or predictions
the tycan sets a new cross-country
cannonball record oh yeah
okay wow we did that that early okay
yeah yeah and then the next episode
was probably the interview yep i think
it was like directly after that yeah
okay
cool all right question
two buzzer finger ready
what was the most viewed nkbhd video
so far this year marquez got it first
air tags unboxing and demo
yeah correct yeah yeah apple hardware i
was
i've originally thought f-150 that's got
to be like second order
yeah yeah air tags is i think seven
million people have watched that
7.2 or something yeah which is crazy i
think f-150 is like 5.9 or something i
was like
kind of sad that the unboxing and demo
got like 7.2 and then our actual like
analysis of the market got like
that's tech youtube baby that's always
how it goes
i've said this before companies love the
fact that the first impressions
are always the the biggest most lasting
impression people have so if you can
make a great first impression that's
great
apple knows that google knows that
samsung they all know that so
yep that one didn't shock me yeah i'm
glad i remembered though i got it right
yeah yeah one point one point
sick oh look i have a score oh it says i
have one point on that
just tell me how bad standing all right
sick
exciting all right for the record that
question was from rich mondulo
on discord and the first one was from
foursbox7
nice thank you to both of you i hope you
all have great usernames i'm banning
both of you because i got them both
wrong
[Laughter]
[Music]
so i'm just you guys should be scared of
andrew
i don't know how i've gotten that like
everyone says andrew's scary on discord
so
andrew's the least scary person possible
i don't know what you're talking about
well now i have one place to be scary
soon
all right question three
what is the first graphic easter egg
that adam put
in the video version of the podcast
ever yes
oh man okay actually i think
so the first episode that he edited did
you guys not watch the video bud
you guys do but i'm trying to remember
the first one there's so many
uh the first episode oh wait the first
video one was like i think we titled it
our first podcast our first video
podcast
um i forgot
i don't know i don't know i don't
remember the topics because i don't
remember the type because the title was
that
it just needs to be the first graphic
but i feel like i need to
that adam added
i thought it was gonna be a trick
question and maybe be like the new intro
that we
had michael created but
i'm stuck do you want to work together
on this one yeah we might get turned out
yeah what is the timeout is this does
the boat horn count as the time house
that might be we might have to have adam
adam should probably answer this one
you should fill us in the first one was
the head shots that we all took in the
studio because you guys were mentioning
everyone in the studio and i had their
headshots pop up
in the video i never ever would have
guessed that yeah i don't know if i
would have said
yeah it's an easter egg i guess that's
why i chose
i would have guessed it was like some
sort of if it was a total guess i would
have guessed like a car
graphic of like some some graphs that
showed like
range or zero to 60s or something just
because we talk about evs all the time
and that's like a nice little
yeah a nice little graphic to talk yeah
that came from maverick on discord
and he said to do or she the easter egg
but i watched like 20 minutes of that
first episode and could not find one so
i changed it to graphics
good to know you guys are way behind hey
if that teaches us anything it's watch
the video podcast
there is definitely way more to this
trivia in the video version than there
is in the audio version that's fair also
edits
the crap out of these i'm sure this will
look really nice this will also be in
like things
a clip as well if you're like if you
listen to this whole episode and really
want to see just the trivia aspect
and just do a clip that'll be there too
all right this next one is kind of fun
okay the way this works is uh
in otter and otter in honor of the oppo
find x3 pro with a microscope
camera oh here are three
more than three here are many close-up
images of random objects oh
whoever gets the most correct wins
okay did you guys go take these or are
these the ones from our videos these are
not even actually
necessarily from the upper finder okay
they're just
in honor mike okay in honor of that oh i
thought i was gonna have to remember
what we shot our photos of
no i was kind of excited i could have
done that all right
okay i'm gonna show you guys the first
one now we just have to identify what
they might be
describe them too oh my god you gotta
hit the buzzer
it looks like hair describing it's hard
because i i want to
hit the buzzer first it just looks like
a paintbrush tip really really zoomed in
but there's no way andrew a paintbrush
tip really really zoomed in
adam correct
wow gotta hit the button baby wow
oh yeah for those audio listeners
someone decided to say it out loud
without pressing the button
so andrew wins sick all right
all right here's that's a good this i
was thinking
like regular brush ready yeah get ready
to hit the buzzer
describe it black textured
with a white x through the middle i'm
guessing like oh my gosh
black x with a texture i'm guessing like
paint
no wait andrew's next uh
tile and grout nope
okay we want to go again i mean it looks
like a piece of apparel with like
rubber like letters on it closer
but i yeah i couldn't tell you what
exactly that is it's just it's an x
it's a really zoomed in x
it's a key on a keyboard of an x a
keyboard oh
wow so i was right technically
i mean i didn't buzz whatever i i don't
deserve that point
i don't think so that was that was tough
yeah okay okay
all right third one ready yes
oh i know what that is but you beat me
andrew ballpoint pen
yeah yep well done okay that was one of
the easier ones
marquez is too busy making sure it's a
fun active show and i'm just like
zeroed in on the buzzer right now you
ready here we go
number four
it's interesting that it's like kind of
cliff like andrew uh
i'm guessing the edge of a carpet
nope i'm gonna buzz i might be wrong but
i think it looks kind of like
the side of a triscuit it does it
it has hair on it though i mean maybe a
triscuit that landed on the floor where
mac
lays down it does so it's tan
it has grooves it i think it looks like
fabric because it has
little pieces of hair coming off but
it's like buzzing right at the
side i'll let you about again if you
want to
this feels like an unfair advantage
for audio listeners marquez is leaning
over the table looking really closely
into the screen
he's trying to magnify this message i
still can't tell what that is
i don't know all right it's a book
like pages of a book oh page oh from
wait
can i see it from the side like those
are like if you put the pages all
together
things look quite different is that can
i guess what book it is
just a random image we found on the
internet i don't know
i keep thinking these are things that
are in the studio no okay
all right there we go again ready
what does it look like a crystal like a
crystal on something
i'm gonna i buzzed yeah i'm just gonna
say i think it's ice
i don't know what part of ice no
sand nope this is a really good picture
i know but i don't know what it is i
buzzed if only the oppo find x3
you're close i will tell you you're
close
it's like it's very clearly a close-up
shot of something that looks like a
crystal so i don't
know what essentially it could be like
what else
i think of salt is like it's a diamond
nope salt was closed very small diamond
that was closed oh salt was close
yeah yeah i don't know what else could
be close to salt that's
like close in that it's a seasoning and
then
yeah i'm i think i give up okay do you
give up
yeah i do it's sugar sugar
really i didn't know sugar was that
sugar crisp fine as
close no yeah that makes sense yep the
oppo find x3 pro could not have taken
any of these maybe the book one the ball
point the bottom
had good enough lighting i think yeah it
did some good ones
i'm hoping that eventually it gets this
good but if they make
if they even make it i do remember we
spent a lot of time with that walking
like it's fine you took pictures of
everything in this it's definitely fun
yeah i bet so if you
oh if you if you showed me the photos
from the video
that we took i could probably identify
like
at least three quarters of the things we
took photos of because i remember like
wow that's what the pool table looks
like right that's what a pool cue looks
like
coffee bean matched the head of a match
uh key
so you know gimmick feature on a phone
yes
but yeah it's still pretty cool i
debated using those pictures but i
thought it would have been unfair to
andrew
oh yeah i mean i use think i recommended
half of them
yeah it was like that was like a team
effort of us just running around yeah
throwing things at marquez to take
pictures yeah i appreciate
trying to keep it uh i tried pg thank
you thank you all right
all right ready yes
oh it's already started wait is it yeah
i think so okay
andrew was first screw boom
yep man i got the easy ones oh andrew's
three the fingers
it's all on the three three two one on
the fingers fastest in the west i need
to buzz faster despite being on the east
coast i need to buzz faster because
there's no penalty for being wrong this
is true
well you get the other person gets a
longer time to
yeah that's fair are you ready yes
and just first soap bubble boom
i used oh boy i was gonna say that but
then
i got okay i was a little worried about
it because it's
it just looks like a bunch of like
refractions kind of
really cool it looks really cool but i
would almost expect
the soap to look like that from further
back not that zoomed in i would expect
zoomed in to be more
specific on one like refraction yeah all
right
this is the last one i need this
question i need this i need this
whoever wins this one gets three points
three points okay could kill me but yeah
let's see
can you turn it a little is it very dark
it is very dark
oh that's velcro
boom hey i've seen velcro from a bunch
of weird angles i don't know why it's
like a bunch of hooks
yeah it's just it's just a bunch of
small nylon hooks [ __ ] each other
yeah weird velcro what a great invention
thanks nasa
boom i just caught up on one question
this wasn't rigged at all
i can't feel that bad since my first
point was based on stealing your answers
yeah andrew also won the last one so i
have to give
a little bit of an advantage oh wait did
you win the last one or did mark has one
no
we keep it fair we keep it fair i
thought i lost the last time i made my
last it was very close
well i'll make it i'll keep it fair for
you no
just keep it pa yeah we're good i just
didn't want to be
have marquez be too far behind you know
what i'm saying okay four four back to
regular questions okay yeah
okay this is an actual question regular
question
all right ready name the correct
order of retro tech season two episodes
and the bonus one that was youtube red
exclusive is
not not in there it's not in there
that's the only one i'm like completely
positive on
i know are youtube premium is that what
they call now
yeah i think it's called youtube premium
okay
all right here we go number one flying
cars
nice number two teleportation number
three
this is where it's tough i think it's
smart homes nope yeah
did i just stop there i can't guess
anymore adam what do you think
i mean i think it would be your benefit
to stop there because you guess any more
than i'm giving you
yeah okay okay all right i'm gonna try
here but i don't know if i even know
it's five right yes okay
i get to just go yeah okay flying cars
smart homes no
flying cars was the hero okay for sure
teleportation was the next best episode
put it second loved it then it was
either smart homes or hyper
or hybrid communication was the behind
the paywall one right
where it was or what are we calling it
for connection hyper connectivity that's
what it's called
wearables is behind the scenes so
wearables is behind so it was hyper
connectivity
smart home all right i'm not doing the
order okay i got the rest of it
hyper connectivity smart homes and what
was the last one
uh retrotech future wearables that was
wearables
you know the grass tyson talked about
flying cars
humanoid robots um i have to remember
you guys kidding now you guys can buzz
in i did it already oh you already did
it yeah you already got it
all right you just hit it again yeah
okay uh oh man
no just start from the beginning okay i
know what it is now
i got it now as soon as you're wrong so
that oh can i
okay i already messed this up i already
forgot the beginning ones
i got it yeah just give it to marcus
i buzzed it in because i remembered the
end but i forgot
okay so number one flying cars
number two teleportation yep number
three
humanoid robots yes number four smart
homes
no hyper connectivity then smart home
well i feel like we're at the part yeah
we should just
end this question and no one gets points
yeah i mean to be fair like getting five
in a row is pretty difficult
you know especially knowing that there
were some favorite children in there
[Laughter]
it's okay at least you both got four
points now so sick all right
all right well if any of you at home got
that before they did you can feel better
that would be really impressive very
impressive if you got that one at home
it is much harder because retrotech is
shot so much different than we're used
to
where it's like you're shooting all of
those episodes at the same
time oh yeah like you shot neil in one
day and that was for every single
episode lots of overlap there yeah we're
very used to a schedule of like when you
guys see a video that was the last thing
we worked on
and it's very very very rare that we're
working on something
in between there so we just know like
what do we work on last it was that's
the last video and what did we work on
before that the video before that
yeah so that was shot for about eight
weeks on and off
in the studio and in the city a bit with
the team
and i'm when i was trying to remember
the order i was trying to remember the
way the thumbnails appear
in the shelf in my head that's what i
was kind of i remember when we were
first doing all the thumbnails
yeah we had like this it was three on
top three on the bottom and
i was trying to imagine that yeah where
was smart homes again was that four
it was the last last one the last one
yeah i really thought i remembered smart
homes bottom quarter but maybe that
wasn't the order maybe that's why i
wearables was technically second but it
was the youtube premium one
well it came out because it came at the
same time as the first one and they just
kept that paywall okay
for the record that question came from
blood tiger xg
shout out to the discord so now so now
we're on the same page
it was teleportation first episode
flying cars flying cars number one
teleportation number two
then we had humanoid robots number three
then we had wearables number four
hyper connected hyper connectivity
number four wearables number five
no and then smart homes and then
wearables
was paywall i'm just gonna stop okay
i'm just gonna stop that's okay this is
i would never be able to get this
like like that was a great question i
don't think i could even like
recite the last five things i had for
dinner so that
me neither that sounds pretty hard
actually yeah
exactly this is even harder than that
that's what i'm saying okay
all right number six this one comes from
adam and i are still four four
yeah still far far all right in the
best mac i've ever reviewed video mac
has a
few basic specs that pop up on screen
what were they
pop up on screen
what we talked about is specs
i remember like a lot of things can i
name one there are three
you can get a point for each one for
each one for each one
uh i buzzed but i don't know
yeah okay one of them was definitely his
eyes so i'm gonna say we went with like
uh mono monochrome sensors up front i
think i labeled that
and then no we didn't yeah it's because
i remember there was like i think we
talked about that but we didn't there's
a lot of things we talked about we
talked about like wireless charging we
talked about him just did we talk about
speed like we just talked about him
being
fast but i don't think it necessarily i
don't remember those
if there's anyone also confused about
what we're talking about
the best mac ever was a dog not
a computer yeah if you're an audio
listener
yeah you should definitely watch that
video uh we'll put it in show notes but
it was not a piece of tech this is our
april fool's day video which is a blast
to make
um and we made a lot of jokes about yeah
monochrome sensors in the front
and wireless charging on his bed
and that he was fast and that he was bad
at learning new tricks and stuff like
that but i don't
i think you guys are overthinking it
those are like the features from the
video there's like one shot where you
just one shot
yeah yeah yeah i'm trying to think of
what specifically you know
it was it not the same shot that the
thumbnail was like the physical
shot it was like this is the midsize
model hold on can i buzz again
andrew are you gonna uh
i don't know give up your time yeah i'll
give up my time okay buzz again if you
want but uh we said it was the
the color i don't remember the color we
made up but we named the color but we
didn't list it
on screen we didn't also i think we
called it like mocha cream oh we did
yeah that wasn't one of them the
mid-size model is that the other one
no i'm we put his weight yes and his
height
yes and his name no
man okay but what did we write
what was his weight in his height and
andrew you could buzz in oh he's about
35 pounds
and i think his height was probably in
inches
i just don't know what it is yeah i
don't know i don't know like
i mean i'm gonna huh and are you waiting
wait
wait should be here weight should be 30
pounds okay
and then height did did we do
24 inches was it inches or was it feet
can i do two feet or 24 inches you could
do two feet
slash 24 inches oh dude was it
centimeters because i have no
idea two feet and how many inches oh two
weeks did we
oh wow okay pretty good so i give you
each two points because marquez
said weight in height yeah and andrew
said the exact same thing
there's one more there's one more thing
cue the music weight height and one more
spec
and it's not color because we already it
wasn't color wasn't name
did we it wasn't breed we didn't do the
just like good boy raiding right there
did we hmm
that was at the end we just gave 11 out
of 10. this one's a little hard so
um i can give you a hint but i feel like
andrew's
yeah what model number year right you
get one point for that
so but then 2013.
[Music]
wow
yes
[Music]
i got too excited boom
got the year second try let's go cool
all right
no i just like the 20 sylla thank you
yeah
that was incredible i'm glad you uh look
we have for you you're after hammerheads
andrew's now two points ahead it was
yeah eight to six
i'm sorry mac if you're watching this i
promise i know you're so don't you know
how old he is
he knew your exact height and weight so
that's pretty cool that's pretty good
that's pretty cool yeah
i don't even know my exact weight yeah
because it fluctuates yeah
i don't know are we guessing buzzing
damn um i mean darn okay
so uh question seven yes
how long is the longest
and shortest videos in the first half of
the year
you can say you can say what the video
is
and then you also get you get two points
if you get
close enough to the time code what's
close enough you know 10 seconds i'm
just gonna start spewing things and you
can tell me if i get any points
okay are you guessing longest or shorter
longest okay uh what i really think of
the iphone
correct 20
no how long was that video
whoo 42 minutes that's my guess
47 you can tell me if the ballpark i
don't know if i'm
46 20. whoever's closer andrew is way
closer really 47 58.
wow nice okay all right so it's one vote
you've got a point okay
so shortest videos shortest in 2021 in
2021
yes okay this one usually gets me i
don't
usually remember the shortest the mac
video was pretty short
i don't think it was back video though
it's going to be an unexpected one i'm
guessing air tags
definitely not air tags had a whole demo
and everything it's gotta be just
an unboxing i'm gonna go with the oh can
i buzz is it the iphone 12 purple
no that was the second shortest shorter
oh wow i know i was actually really
surprised that this was shorter than
that
yeah um wow did we announce but we had
like a two minute like
luminar thing in the iphone 12 thing oh
that's true that's true so that's why
oh it would have been the shortest yeah
okay um did we announce anything
like channel specific this year no
like video podcast came out but we
didn't
oh that was like we threw that at the
end of a video yeah right yeah yeah
think of it's six months so it's quite a
while yeah
a lot of stuff has happened that seems
really old but isn't that old if you
think about it yeah but what was
small in the last year
it doesn't even necessarily need to be a
small thing yeah
that's video short i'm just trying to
give you hints yeah
so he's like this came out in january
yeah which makes me think it's not
necessarily large no no it's not
necessarily large
small in terms of like importance is
what i'm saying it's not necessarily
small in terms of importance
just because the video is short it's
also hard because like we didn't do a
straight up
ios one we did like an ios
the shortest videos yeah the the
shortest videos are typically unboxings
because not much happens after the
unboxing unless you get into first
impressions
there's event recaps but those are
usually pretty long reviews are usually
pretty long
so maybe ooh maybe it's the s
i'm buzzing yep maybe it's the uh
front-facing camera behind the glass
video
that was pretty short no no that was a
pretty short one though yeah
yeah yeah that was that was the third
shortest
really yeah oh my god you guys i'm all
over this one
yeah i'm getting warmer i'm like pretty
injured you have a follow-up no do you
want to go one more hint
okay do you want to reset the button
okay sure
it was a phone
a video about a phone okay and remember
six months was it that so it could have
been any time within the last six months
the find x3 no no i wasn't sure if maybe
we just did the
most of the microscope stuff quickly and
here's another
it was a video did you did before i was
around
before i was born
i'm just going through the phones in my
head sounding pretty long
it's a samsung impressions i'm gonna go
samsung
s21 impressions correct yeah that's
how i started thinking of that because
there's so many of them and there's
gonna yeah it's mostly ultra and then
you kind of like
yeah all right yeah and then and how
long was that how long was that oh i
need this i need this to tie you right
yeah oh god how close should we go i'll
let you guess first how close do we have
to get
uh whoever gets closer feel it out
whoever gets whoever is closer
yeah this is whoever is a closer delta
impressions six minutes 55 seconds
five minutes no six minutes 54 seconds
oh this is
this is savage yeah what was it
six minutes 28 seconds oh i was gonna go
like 5 50. so i'm glad i
i'm glad i went out okay no i think that
still would have been closer okay
yeah that would have been closer i'm
glad i remember that's the only reason
can you buzz marquez i can give you a
point oh there we go
boom nine nine nine nine i told you it's
gonna end in a tie
i mean well we have one one question oh
we do wow actually
how convenient we have two questions
left okay oh did we miss
yeah that question came from four's box
seven again
great question great question yeah these
are discord i'm really proud of y'all
well pretty good
like i'm sure it was a total mess when
you first started that channel but like
these are
really good questions eventually it got
good shout outs this is discord yeah
cause one of the questions
this might not be one of them but i
think it'll be interesting we found the
most and least
time have we we found the most viewed
what was the least viewed do you
remember
do you remember wait the least viewed
video the least viewed video from the
first half of this year
oh man what is the least viewed from
this i can find out right now i feel
like there was one we were specifically
watching and it was like
you guys having a hard time cracking a
million and
wait but you can't was uh this isn't
points we're just doing it yeah i know i
know
uh but it's no not a retro like let's
not
yeah yeah not right because yeah those
didn't i think it's
actually sundar's interview um
cinder's interview i think that's gonna
be you're gonna have to look through a
lot that was 2.5
that was probably i think we have lower
i think one plus watch and cinder's
interview had the same amount of views
actually
i'm gonna weirdly say it's the best mac
ever i actually
i think it's like 1.6 million one point
one point nine is it up there
but that's still kind of low yeah that's
one of the lowest uh there's one lower
than that
in the last six months yep one less than
max video actually there's two
less than that at least
yeah there's at least two less than that
i don't know what were they
one was the one plus nine review because
the number oh because
video did 3.5 the oneplus 9 to 1.8
the one that did even less than that was
the
ultimate custom playstation 5. oh right
man that was like one of the best
thumbnails though that thumbnail one of
the best so
good and whatever happened to
playstation 5
seo just being crazy well look at some
other playstation 5 stuff and that's why
i think we were a little later with that
with all that stuff
so that's probably why the the ps5 hype
was kind of died down
yeah i mean it's still it's still crazy
but from what it was
and people were starting to get their
ps5 already by then so that
max unboxing impressions has 11 million
views
insane okay all right all right back to
the
question the official questions um all
right
hit the yeah right boom all right
this is last question right now there's
two more okay all right
estimate the total length of waveform
episodes
from this year from the beginning of the
year like combined
yeah and you can do i'll give points for
minutes and hours
oh my god estimate the total length of
all of them
from from this year
70 hours um
70 hours 20 minutes no you're way over
or way way way over six months and six
months times four weeks each is
42 weeks so i'm gonna go 42 hours
wait oh yeah i am how are we closer but
still way over
oh my god i know i did that that would
be total because
this is episode 69. nice
thank you um and i just did on that
so yeah you're right 40. we're just
doing this year yeah just this year
i thought we renamed episode numbers for
the start of the year but that makes
no sense we have a lot of like 45 to 50
minute and then a couple 90 minutes
it seems like we only do one of the
other to be honest i would just average
it i would just average it at an hour
that's what marquez just did and i was
over at 42. yeah but we haven't done 42
episodes this year
true we're not at full we're not fully
through june this is the second to last
weekend oh wait because there's only
four
there's only 52 weeks in a year so it
should be like
26 hours and february only has three
weeks yo andrew
definitely gets a point for that 25.73
hours
oh much lower than i thought wow that
really though just proves that both of
us are really
bad at it all right now this is a speed
round for how fast
how fast can you do this math how many
minutes is 25.73 hours
this is marquez's he went to a smart
school how many minutes i went to film
school
i have no chances i haven't taken math
since i was a sophomore in high school i
don't think
it's just 24 times 60. yeah 25.73 times
60. well
okay 25 times 60.
it's 15. one five zero
1500 plus adam you've got to do the math
thing in front of his head
1500 plus 70 times
60 times 0.7 you said okay google
73.73 is there one around here siri
just give me uh 1540
ish 1544 okay close enough close enough
can you buzz in
1544. can you also buzz in i just want
to see the points you have oh you're
both a 10.
let's go there's one last question
mental math oh man
okay all right if only this ipad had a
calculator on it
yeah well i think i could have had that
last wait is there a widget on the
on the beta yet no all right last one
all right you guys ready
last question yeah this is for it all
it's all it all comes down to this all
right
how long to the nearest minute was wwdc
one hour 59 minutes and john goes one
hour 58 minutes
i was actually going to guess that i was
well you did this to me already so i
can't even feel bad but i was actually
gonna guess one hour 15 minutes
because i feel like we downloaded it and
i thought that's what it is one hour
46.49 so andrew wins
the crowd goes that's pretty savage dude
well done
you have no honor sir i wasn't trying to
do it like that i actually thought
that's really funny
i guess you could have guessed one
minute over and marcus still would have
won
true yeah i could have went both ways so
you had a 50 50 chance of winning
i guess you always had a 50 50 chance
yeah
literally whatever you guessed all right
well that was close wow that was good
that was really fun you both won one
trivia did uh
whose question was that was that from
discord no that was one of ours
but the um length of all waveform
episodes comes from discord user
luna norden with a little duck creative
that was created yeah again discord big
shout out to everyone on there if you're
not on discord um
it's linked in the show notes i think i
have it as always in there now
discord.js
go check it out slash mkbhd yeah very
easy there it is
yeah i'm in there sometimes yelling at
people
well that was a fun fun little game
trivia we're going to take a quick break
we'll come back we'll do some q a
all right welcome back we're doing some
video q a
now when i asked on twitter for some
video q a
what i meant was send in your video
recorded
record your video of yourself asking a
question and we'll answer
with our video but i think a lot of
people just wrote text questions about
video
which is fine we'll do both we'll start
with the video questions we'll move on
but
uh this is just a little q a because we
like to bring this back on the podcast
once in a while we have david with us as
well so we can all answer questions and
whatever we feel like answering
let's do it yeah i have stuff up on my
phone so i'm just gonna play it and then
we'll
okay do you think google will ever reach
the upper level of ecosystem
given the rumors of the new google pixel
6 with the white chapel soc which is
made in-house in google
damn it would be awesome if google had
the level of integration such as apple
did
and also which do which phones do you
have in your pocket right now
peace bunch of bunch of parts to that
question
uh do i think they'll ever reach the
level of integration
of ecosystem apple has just in the phone
i think they can do it with their own
soc
and i'm really looking forward to it but
their ecosystems are very different
actually
if you just look at all the services
that that google does that apple doesn't
like
gmail google search youtube
google calendar that whole thing uh
versus like what apple builds which is a
bunch of different hardware products
i don't see them being congruent anytime
soon
but if we're just talking about the
phone which i think is what he's
referring to i
i do think they can basically match
the level of integration it just depends
on how much we trust
google's pixel team yeah i was gonna say
if you watch
the video about uh why apple's features
are always late
it's kind of that reason it's like
google makes google has all these teams
that don't really work together and they
just
make random weird cool stuff uh even
though it's
slower now than it used to be so they
don't really
work together to have that level of
integration and like mark has said like
hardware wise apple's always just making
their integration crazy
um google's hardware is you know they
don't really have
as much of the like personal hardware
yeah
so i don't really see it happening on
either an app side or a hardware side to
be honest
i kind of feel like they're going to
release the pixel watch and it'll have
like one or two integration features and
then they'll forget about it
that's the thing too how long will it
last because there are a lot more
cancelled google products than there are
shout outs killed by google yeah twitter
i mean i think
whitechapel is the most excited we've
been about like getting
close to that in a long time because now
we're just
one more step closer to all the hardware
being together
and mutually like mutual but it's
still like you said there's just so many
different things and and android's whole
thing has kind of been
they work with a million different
companies and like that's just
it's never going to happen to the point
that like apple has their wallet garden
thing about white chapel for me is i
think that it's going to be more about
optimizing
the phone and just making the apps run
smoother and making everything feel
smoother but it
even though technically that would make
the integration with other hardware
products that run whitechapel
better i don't think google will execute
on that very well
so i think the phone will definitely
feel smoother google apps will maybe
feel smoother
and maybe they'll be able to have some
sort of like airdrop thing that works
between devices but like again they make
chromebooks
it's like yeah you can lock your
chromebook but like yeah yeah it's not
like there's a macbook pro from google
and an apple watch from google and a
homepod from i mean they make a google
nest max thing yeah it's not quite the
same so
audio yeah there's just not a there is
some overlap which is why we view them
as competitors but
you know how well will they execute on
it i don't know probably not
we'll see i wanna i'm cross i wanna be
optimistic yeah i love it right
i would love them to pull it off yeah
yeah we should be optimistic
can i insert a question or an answer
yeah i think that
google is going to take a cloud approach
and apple does a lot of things hardware
based
but with stadia and google drive and
gmail and all that stuff they're trying
to make
all of their devices seem congruent in
an ecosystem but in the cloud
yeah if the stadia is any indication of
that i'm not looking forward to it well
very very
[Laughter]
[Music]
but the the white chapel thing is
interesting because
if they do want to have this incredible
level of hardware integration
with a really powerful well optimized
cpu then that would
work directly against this like cloud
computing
thing that they're so good at so i don't
know if it's just because
they've seen it work really well on the
phone that they want to attack it on the
phone
and then work with the cloud through
other platforms and maybe there's like a
multi-faceted google doesn't talk to
each other approach where we'll do cloud
over here and we'll do local processing
over here
but i think it's a combination because
like a lot of the re a lot of the way
that apple stuff works well together is
through icloud too
yep like when you when you do things
when you send uh
like imessage and you do airdrop and you
do like unlock your mac
with your apple watch those all have to
be logged into your icloud account
yeah so that is fairly tied to the cloud
true we'll see uh this question i think
would just be fun to do on the podcast
can we see a behind-the-scenes shot of
the setup for the video podcast
yes i'm gonna take a selfie and adam
could just post it in the video
boom there we go we're done now you've
seen it now you've seen the scenes
and now you've seen the behind the
scenes sick
all right next video next video yes
you mean next question yeah video
questions oh yeah go for it
all right let's let's see i don't know
what this question
i have two questions one is
do you think that the future of tech is
gonna be
uh unbelievably large and super reliant
batteries that just
never need charging like uh what tesla
is trying to do
or do you think that it's just going to
be uh
super fast over-the-air wireless
charging
everywhere such that you can have like a
little bit of battery
but that's just always constantly being
filled up uh
like what you're seeing with a lot of
xiaomi phones that's uh number one
and number two um why don't you guys
have brendan ward on the podcast
like he's super dope and the bromance
between him and david is actually all
right
i'm cutting that off out brandon will
now never be on the podcast because of
this he's
already been on the phone um yeah
brandon has been on the podcast though
actually we almost debated getting them
on this week but um
expect brandon and vin to be on whenever
we do like really really intense
uh like robot shots or something like
that or a really
fun intro and they'll usually come on
and describe it but they'll definitely
be on sometimes
back to the question the original
question
is the battery i think the first
question is really interesting
so i immediately when i said that i was
like no i i
firmly i don't know why i really believe
that the the future is going to be like
almost no batteries batteries will be
super efficient and super small
and very quick to charge and it will be
available
like everywhere you go to charge up this
is like really far future i'm talking
so like you're obviously you think about
it now in your phone like
it's got this little battery cell in it
and everywhere you go you just put it
down on the table and it tops up
and you put it in your car and it tops
up and you just always have battery
someday in the future
imagine your electric car has
like a 50 kilowatt hour battery it's no
big deal
but like literally everywhere you go you
just park in one of these designated
spots and it's just inductive charging
your car everywhere
so you just have to stop for it it still
stops but because like
he almost made it sound like in the
future it's like uh
you're just literally connected all the
time and at that point is it even
a battery or is it basically just like a
wireless plug
it's like a small cell that powers you
you know it it doesn't necessarily need
to be a huge battery to get you
right now we have huge batteries because
we go a long time without plugging in
yeah that's really the basic equation so
the the
the smaller of a time you go between
plugging in
the less battery power you need yeah
yeah i guess
in this a battery always has to have a
charge and that gives you power but that
charge
ends and then therefore needs to be
recharged did it almost sound like he
was talking about like
a a future which would be even further
than the very distant future where like
they're almost you are charging all the
time they're like yeah wirelessly
everything in the world there's demos at
ces every year of like
wireless power yeah like in front of
like your tv they've just got a
transmitter that's doing like a low
voltage thing to your phone
yeah and like they work yeah i think
that like literally
yeah barely and it's also kind of like
at what point should we be worried about
this
um yeah there's a lot of questions here
yeah there's that there's like what
happened do you guys remember the solar
freaking roadways video that blew up a
few years ago
those like tiles that yeah that's
neglected that like the roads dirty
they get dirty yeah yeah but i mean
yeah i mean stuff like that i like that
and then and also if you think about
like ikea is putting out
like a ton of furniture that has
wireless chargers in it all the time
yeah and that's something i thought
about a lot recently is like at my
apartment michael and i have wireless
chargers
everywhere and i don't think i've
plugged my phone in
for like eight months my car is almost
the only place i plug mine in
you guys are as a wireless charger yeah
so your car your your house is closer to
the house of the future where i guess
someday you won't even have to put it
down
on the coils yeah it will just be near
an area
and that will always be topped up and so
you'll have a 5000 milliamp hour battery
but you'll always be at 90
because everywhere you go you're near
something it's kind of like that xiaomi
uh wireless charger that like moves the
coil to your phone yeah like every table
that was like those coils in it yeah
that was the super basic
physical solution to the tech we don't
have yet but yeah someday i think that
would be pretty cool i feel like a kind
of realistic way to look at this would
be
i could see in still in the distant
future but
everything in an area that is maybe our
own
or uh a place where you stop at for
longer
would have wireless but slower charging
whereas therefore when you are on the go
that's where you get
plug-in hyper-fast charging and like in
terms of cars and stuff like that too
like
it wouldn't surprise me if your garage
could get fitted with some sort of a
car wireless charger but they're not
gonna go do that at
like wireless charging is always a step
behind wired charging and
no matter what even with tesla
superchargers and 20-minute charging
like
that's a number they're gonna want to
get down until it's
at one minute or whatever or you're
going in there equal to what
a gas station i think just matching and
beating gas yeah exactly so i think
the much more realistic would be
potentially slower wireless
easy like a fit or like yeah easier
charging at home or in a place where you
would park your car
longer but then still on the go needs to
be that way
it's gonna be super fast yeah i think i
could see that being
a future where the only reason i don't
see it with cars is because they're
still so
huge compared to every other battery we
have yeah and when the battery is that
huge
and you you lose a lot of wireless
charging
efficiency to heat and that's like okay
for a phone because the phone is so
small but when you're charging and
you're spending like significant money
on electricity
you really want to just go straight into
the car oh you're saying less efficient
yeah so like your electricity bill would
be higher charging your car with
wireless charging because of how much
energy you lose to heat
unless the technology though i mean i'm
assuming this is a technology we haven't
invented yet and maybe it would become
more efficient
yeah yeah makes sense i would love a
future
where we don't plug things in it would
be nice to just park in your garage
and you start every morning full charge
yeah that would be awesome you're in my
garage
here in my garage um all right here's a
question
yeah uh which company do you think will
be the next most successful company
in creating their own ecosystem similar
to apples
so i guess one the first question for
that would be is there a company that
has like a
what's the second best ecosystem next to
apple weirdly
it's samsung i mean it has to be samsung
but it's like
just because of short sheer hardware and
products
but none of them are fully congruent
enough to like really match each other
like if you
if you just mentally go all right
samsung's number one because nobody can
match samsung's tvs refrigerators and
appliances
then no matter how good apple stuff is
you'll never match that
but since we look we're referring to
apples as like the number one can you
ever match apple right
then we have to say okay can samsung
make a phone can samsung make a tablet
can samsung make laptops
speakers and a bunch of the services
that tie them all together and they make
smart speakers who knows
they've been working on that thing for a
while
uh yeah maybe so it's it's tough to
compare directly apples to apples no pun
i guess that is a pun intended yeah um
but yeah they've got icloud they've got
like the
the seamless transition between the mac
and the ipad and they've got the m1
chips like that is a very
tightly knit well done integration in an
ecosystem
that's hard to match from anyone but
it's hard to argue anyone has a better
shot right now just in terms of pure
products that you could get
yeah it is connected together lg one
would have been one
but now they don't yeah and they never
really tried to make their products
integrated yeah they did a few things
where like you could see your watchers
cycle on your phone but it was just an
app but just in the sense of having
but just in the sense of having phone
smart watch tablet
computer refrigerator and literally
everything and then it's a software
thing
i might actually say xiaomi personally
they've got a lot true they have a lot
of products
and whether or not they integrate as
closely as apples do
they are trying and a few of their stuff
does do that like they have their they
have laptops that people don't really
know about
and you can do stuff on your phone with
the laptop there's quick share wow
that kind of stuff huawei has huawei
quick share all that stuff
i think if huawei had not gotten kind of
like kneecapped
uh they might have been a runner-up but
i think xiaomi is like
especially because they just have so
much freaking stuff yeah they make
everything and really high quality
hardware
i would say the what was i going to say
oh
apples is the one ecosystem that seems
to get modeled after in a way where they
don't really
talk to other ecosystems at all they
kind of just pretend the others don't
exist
so like you'll see the homepod come out
and it's like you have an android phone
that's a useless product to you where
like if you have
uh i don't think huawei makes a smart
speaker but if you just insert any like
nest hub or like any other some of these
products that are part of other
ecosystems you could still have
an iphone and work with them you could
have an lg phone
and use a huawei tablet and an lg laptop
and a samsung fridge and they'll
be okay and they won't work great
together but like
i bet you if apple makes a fridge you
won't even be able to open it with an
android
phone so it's uh it's a definite it's a
different
mentality that they take to it but yeah
yeah closest
i would if i were to just give one name
i would say samsung actually
interesting yeah interesting do you guys
have another one i think i have another
video oh sweet hi marcus hi andrew
i was wondering what do you think are
some of the biggest dangers that
technological advancement and progress
might entail and what solutions would
you implement
to prevent them from happening wow i
actually have a really question
here that you and i were talking about
pretty recently okay and that's with
and i don't think this is exactly what
he's going out but right now
technology and electric cars is pushing
us to these like
0 to 60 times that are just like
unheard of especially and we've talked
about it before the model s is a
just like regular everyday car and it's
going 1.9
now with plaid at what point is this
getting to a
dangerous aspect of potentially needing
like a specialty license to drive
a full-size sedan like
like i said this is very different i
think from the question but like i think
that's reasonable
yeah like worry like at what point we
see all these
you see all those videos of like people
crashing their mustangs because they
have way too much horsepower
and maybe that's mostly because rear
wheel drive where most evs now are
four-wheel um but or all wheel whatever
you want to call it um
but those are enthusiasts also in
mustangs uh i have some potentially
controversial thoughts about these
okay things uh what's your most
controversial
thought that might get you canceled
marcus yeah yeah okay so
so so speed limits and like the way our
infrastructure
and not just the us but a lot of
countries like safety wise
the way the rules are built are pretty
old
so this like you know speed limit 50
speed limit 60 thing is designed because
it was
literally dangerous to drive your car
faster than that
there were no safety measures there were
no air bags there were no things like if
you crash at 50 miles an hour that's a
major problem
but i guess today the the level of
what's like safe by most people is
higher than
it was before at least so you know you
see like
people crashing a mustang because it has
way too much horsepower but that's just
because they're a
bad driver like if you crash a new car
in 2020
you are a much worse driver all right
and it's gonna be much
it's just it's much safer in today's
cars than it ever has been
there's a recent doug demura video about
this actually um
i guess all of that is to say yeah you
shouldn't drive your car
crazy you shouldn't drive your car to
the limits that's what the tracks and
the recreational spaces are for
but you've always not always you've
lately
had the ability to do unsafe speed
things for a long time there are
lots and lots of cars out there that can
go way faster than anyone's ever
supposed to go on the road and we're
just not supposed to do that on the road
i would argue there that the
the power is becoming the initial power
that's potentially uncontrollable is
becoming way more accessible to people
who aren't buying
right now it's not accessible to get a
car that goes that fast unless you are
specifically seeking out right a
performance car
we're looking at model three yeah you're
going
three seconds zero to 60 like you're
starting to get and we know tesla
they're gonna chip that down farther and
farther you're getting to
uncontrollable speed not uncontrollable
way more dangerous speeds for people who
are bad drivers which will never be
eliminated i would argue it's not the
speed
this is acceleration yeah it's
acceleration but if you
go if you floor it in a model s in a
straight line
it is way faster and way more safe than
if you floor it in a straight line in a
720s
i've flirted in a straight line at 720s
and but that doesn't take into
consideration variables on the road
and like roads like it's still unsafe
for people who aren't used to
controlling power like that yeah both
are unsafe
and you're talking about bad drivers
here which will never stop i mean we
have people crashing cars all the time
now
you're taking those people and giving
them an ungodly amount of power
which feels very dangerous it's true
that the price of
the price to performance has come down
constantly over the years
um i just feel like we've had dangerous
levels of performance for many years
yeah it's just more accessible now to
more bad drivers
uh more so than before yeah i don't see
i don't know we've had mustangs for
years yeah but i feel like you're
generally a
like that's something you're seeking out
for because you want a performance car
well a model is a hundred fifty thousand
yeah i know but it's
probably the same model three is still
going three
three point five and like that's gonna
chip down what happens when a model 3 is
going
to is it less safe because it's going to
yeah
is the mustang more safe because it's
slower
oh that's different because of the rear
wheel drivers is all wheel drive well
that's what i'm saying it's like them
going faster isn't necessarily less safe
i think it's about other things that's
why the mustang
there's still an acceleration curve when
you're on gravel or a loose road or
something like that that no matter what
that's
there are ways to unsafe and there's
other variables on the road like other
drivers
animals crossing the road pedestrians
all of that is very unsafe
maybe not to the person in the car but
maybe to the person walking across the
road
that now you're going two seconds zero
to 60 across that intersection rather
than
seven seconds across that yes i just
think it's something
to be wary of and i would i would still
argue
it's getting less safe i would say a
minor minor counterpoint is like
if you are a good driver and you are
aware that 0 to 60 also helps you avoid
accidents
yeah it's true i don't think that they
have done before i don't think there's
not prices i've had someone has almost
hit me and i've just been able to just
like i think there's a ton of pros to it
i think merging on highways is going to
get
way easier and safer because of that but
yeah i still think their
drives the factor of there are a lot of
people i would never
in the world want so to his question is
there a solution
to any of this i don't know all
driverless cars all the time i wouldn't
i
wouldn't be surprised if in the future
we get regulations on some of these
things
on max speed legal regulations not on
max speed or on fastest acceleration
i don't know where it would happen i
have two thoughts on this to be honest
number one uh this is just a fun fact is
plowed model s is now actually too fast
to go flat out
at a recreational drag strip because
there is a minimum quarter mile time
before which you need parachutes to
legally be able to use
the drag yeah and if you go flat out you
will be banned from the drag strip from
going too fast without a parachute
that's
pretty hilarious real quick before your
next thing though yeah that is open to
somebody doing on a highway right now
yes that but that's a highway versus a
prepared drag strip straight line
yeah but what's the safety measure of
that that you're reaching the
out outside of the if you need the
parachutes to not go off the track at
the end
yes so that means that you need the
parachutes to not crash into someone
potentially stopped on the house so
that's also
older the parachute is an older rule
like this
these parachutes came from like cars
from the 90s needed a parachute to stop
and now we have a model s with the
biggest breaks i've ever seen
but the the second part of that is if
there's any car that i want to be able
to go 0 to 60 really fast
it's the one with the best safety rating
the one with the biggest crumple zone
the one with the newest tech the one
that's least likely to get
hurt in which is the one that's the good
but the one that
you're inside that has nothing to do
with the other person i'm just saying
scenario best case scenario if you're
saying there's going to be a car that
does 0 to 60 and 1.9 which card do you
want it to be uh
i guess i want it to be the safest one
but yes no matter what happens on the
outside you're at least
making the inside variable safer but
yeah okay
so now that andrew did his co did his
answer yeah
do you have a do you have a piece of
tech that
you think to be yeah i feel like this is
youtube
he was probably looking for like ai i've
got a couple thoughts but i want to let
you
go if you have a dangerous um i think
generally tech has done a good job of
staying
safe because number one you don't want
the bad pr number two
anytime you get anywhere near unsafe you
have to deal with the ftc and
or fcc federal trade ftc
so obviously there's been exceptions to
that samsung had battery problems as we
all remember
um but those are exceptions to the rule
so when i look at the most
dangerous tech or the tech with the most
potential to be dangerous it kind of has
to be
sort of like low-key behind the scenes
dangerous like
is all of your data being sold that type
of dangerous
um accessibility through like the
internet or through like a
place that has a common area that
somebody can gain access to
i think is what would scare me the most
yeah
access to all of your data through
someone
with poor intentions right yeah yeah i
don't know if i have a good like
single product or something where it
needs this solution that i can propose
but ai is definitely one that's the one
that i think ai there's also
before david answers like similar on
there it's just like
i feel like boss dynamics is one of
those ones where everyone wants to be
scared but
to me i'm that doesn't worry me
really yeah i mean maybe i should we see
all these i would mine might be slightly
worried about those because if someone
got a hold of one and put
guns on that's the thing so boston
dynamics is being
very careful at the very beginning which
is who can even get their hands on the
robot in the first place talking about
putting things in the hands of the
public
you cannot buy a boston dynamics robot
without talking to boston dynamics about
exactly what you're going to do with it
them approving it and then having you
sign a contract saying
if you do anything else we're taking it
back so is it that or is it just
they stop software updates and no more
uh i'm not sure this is the customer
service i think it was so like
definitely you can still run it but it
basically is snapped but it's not like
your your crazy uncle can buy one and
send it off to do something crazy
for you because he will not be able to
get his hands on one so
that's what boston dynamics is doing
which is smart and i think a lot of
companies who make
products like that probably think about
this type of stuff a lot we don't want
the liability we don't want any products
to be dangerous
yeah but yeah i don't know what's the
solution other than
do good yeah work for a company that
make thing
seems to be the best solution for all of
these is be a good human being
yeah it will never happen i have two
um one of them is is kind of cliche but
i think it's like social media like
unregulated social media
and just the way that it is probably
screwing with a lot of younger people's
heads right now
and just the lasting effects that that
will have on people's self-image within
the next 10 years
i think there are actually when you grow
up with it and like your entire world
view is the entire world
and everyone looks perfect all the time
i think that's
gonna be i think there's gonna be a
pretty major mental health crisis in
about
five to ten years is this a bad time to
plug that you should subscribe to the
[Applause]
video podcast yeah so that's a obviously
that's a
that's a kind of a cliche one but i no i
totally also firmly believe that's gonna
happen
and it the fact that it's just the
platforms are driven around
engagement and staying on the platform
and because of that have just kind of
gone out of control
i totally agree and there's attempts at
solving it that i don't think
yeah i don't think they're working very
well at all um because at the end of the
day these companies still need you on
their platform for as long as possible
the other thing is crispr um which
do you guys know what crispr is is that
the is that the dna
yeah manipulation yeah type stuff it's
gene editing basically
they take this cutter protein virus and
it goes in and
the way that your genes are laid out is
like a sequence
right so if they can identify certain
sequences that cause certain diseases
they can literally cut one of the
sequences out and replace it with
another one and then you won't have the
disease
and while that's like incredible and
amazing and they've been working on this
for a long time
uh there are very scary implications of
this because
while you know some people some people
have
in the past thought that there was like
superior genetic humans
that didn't exist now there actually
will be
and it's going to be i mean if if this
got so if this
like became available on an open market
only the richest people would be able to
afford it and if only the richest people
could make the
most superior human babies then
the rich would be genetically superior
which would keep them rich
which would keep them genetically
superior and it would just become this
like
so it's a whole thing and what's the
solution to this
hit him with your car that goes zero
it's a really hard problem because like
if we could eliminate cancer
yeah it's one of those questions oh yeah
it's one of those
there's actually a worldwide ban right
now yeah using it currently
currently um but it's it's a really
interesting topic but
also very scary because it could easily
cause like a
a ridiculous amount of like classism
there's a lot of genetic classism which
is scary as hell
anyway i read a book about this but yeah
potentially yeah they uh
they is yeah they invented it at my
college that's why what college is that
uc santa cruz shout out to uc santa cruz
changing the world
yeah um okay uh anyone else have more
do you want to do anything we're pretty
far anywhere we are fairly far in right
okay this might be fun okay if you could
only live with three pieces of tech for
a month what would they be
oh that's such a hard question because
how do you define a piece of text also
you're done you have
phone cards so two well yeah three is a
lot actually
i can't live without my card actually
this is an interesting question yeah
what is a piece of tech yeah what is
technology are you saying like
using your lights at home would be tech
is that that's
there are a lot of gray area pieces of
tech in my life
that i would not be sure if they count
or not um my house has a nest thermostat
do i have to not use my thermostat
correct i okay let's okay hold on
let's see this if it is a smart object
let's assume in this month
within the snap of a finger you can turn
it back to the old version the dumb
version of it the non-tech version so if
your thermostat you can still change
your thermostat but you can't do it from
your phone and you can't
set it from beforehand because it's
funny because all we're really doing is
not
connecting it to the internet but it's
still a thermostat
but it's one that you can see
[Music]
yeah okay let's just say internet
connected
okay well i was gonna say the internet
was one of my things in tech so i wasn't
sure
yeah i think
yeah i mean i don't want to learn
something i don't know but then you'd
have to be like my router my modem
yeah and my laptop and the wall that
would suck
no i'm going to go handheld i'm gonna go
bonus three pieces of tech yeah phone is
everything
it's one it would be a challenge to like
try to pick three and not include the
phone but i'm i'm definitely gonna
put my phone as one yeah then
piece of tech so for a month
i'm gonna need a camera and i'm gonna
need a
computer of some sort just because are
you going to attempt to create
make videos for that month looks like
we're gonna have real bad audio
yeah so i'm doing like just one
audio and i guess when i say camera i'm
going like camera
setup the stuff plugged into the camera
wait so here what camera
because like i was gonna say with like a
c300 with it does that have the onboard
microphone on it
i don't know if i want to edit that on a
laptop i'm just going like laptop is the
computer
because my three things are phone laptop
and camera laptops you can bring around
with you yeah
so if i can edit on 16 macbook pro
and i've got let's go sony a7s3 with the
mic plugged in
with an sd card month without music uh
my phone
my phone can do music yeah yeah spotify
i guess
yeah i'm mostly using my phone yeah
that's fine okay i can hear you just be
one of those people that plays
would you go would you go headphones
over one of those i think i would yeah
oh interesting i think i go
phone headphones and
i could probably even go without my
probably i guess
laptop laptop phone headphones live yeah
that's easy i think i would do
phone three is pretty there's a lot yeah
yeah phonavi
i don't i would honestly not do a laptop
i would probably do my
computer at home because i like to play
games at night
and that's one thing right now i haven't
i haven't played valerian in like a
month and it's
so all the peripherals and all the
things that connect to it are part of
the computer yeah
in this example yeah right like is that
i don't know i think
if i can go sd card and microphone then
you can go keyboard what if what if they
all yeah like they're
they're all part of the computer because
they stay at the computer and they don't
go anywhere else so like my headphones
my keyboard mouse like i don't bring
those around for anything else i would
say because they're plugged into it
yeah yeah yeah okay yeah okay
that's correct but that's only two yeah
it's only two honestly
i don't really know i kind of don't want
my phone
[Music]
the problem is i literally couldn't
survive without it which kind of sucks
i do most of my internet stuff on my
phone
unless i'm at my work computer or i'm at
my home computer i still barely even do
stuff on that i
really carry a lot i was gonna say i
could probably swap out my laptop for
something but if it was gonna be for a
month
and i got really what's a computer
it was for a month and i got really
bored i guess i'd want to play dota or
something so i could do it on my laptop
yeah a month is a long time a month is a
while well that's a good one to end it
on i guess yeah that was pretty fun
yeah sick all right well this has been
your
semi-annual game show slash video q a
next time i'll make it super clear that
we want
video questions and then we'll have more
of a conversational style
but if you haven't already subscribed to
the waveform youtube channel definitely
do that we're doing a video version of
the podcast
audio only listeners we still love you
