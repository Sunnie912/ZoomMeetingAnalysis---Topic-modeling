all right what's going on everybody
welcome back to the waveform podcast
we're your hosts
i'm marquez and i'm andrew and that's
not andrew actually surprise wow
for the audio only listeners david just
ripped his face off i ripped andrew's
face
we ripped andrew's face off welcome
david mel
to waveform episode 70. so uh shout out
to andrew he's out in
the mountains right now going on fun
hikes climbing big rocks
i'm sure having a good time but uh we
still have plenty of tech to talk about
and figured we'd
put it all in one place here um our last
episode
was episode 69 nice there it is and uh
we took some time to do a
fun little like game show type thing
that we built so it's a sort of a tech
trivia show you can play along
it's about like tech and videos from the
first half of the year it's it's a
little more visual heavy for maybe for
that one go to the youtube channel for
it
but we're back with a bunch of tech to
talk about
i kind of want to start with windows 11
because you said are you running windows
11 not on this computer this is actually
andrew's computer i
left my surface book at home sadly um
but i am running windows 11 on my
surface book
so it was just unveiled last week and
now there's a build available for the
public to actually download and try
i made a reaction video just like
talking about my couple major
thoughts on the new changes it's very
glassy and shiny and transparent overall
the start menu centered now that you've
used it for a little bit maybe a day or
two
have you found some things like super
easy to get over
or like really jarring or have you
gotten used to all of it how's it going
a couple different
things i found that one it sort of feels
like microsoft is
trying to simplify everything with the
ui they're trying to make
it from what i've gathered it feels like
they're they're moving the ui elements
more towards feeling like a phone
which is pretty funny but it kind of
makes sense
uh especially for the generations that
are growing up right now if they want to
onboard all of these like kids yeah
that have been using phones since they
were born yeah there's the there's the
big pullover thing from the side
which is where all these widgets and ai
news
feeds live is that part of what you're
talking about it's that and then
everything's bigger and bubblier
um so for example in regular windows 10
yeah if you like click down on like
there's all these icons in the bottom
right with like battery management you
can switch power modes and all these
things
now you click and there's just like one
set of
quick settings that comes up okay and
they're they're all
pretty big icons they're individual and
you can swap them out it's almost like
the quick settings menu on your phone
yeah and you can edit what's there and
they're big and then all the menus
just look completely different they're
more simplified uh they're definitely
more aesthetically pleasing
okay and so i think it's definitely
something windows
needed to do because they're kind of
known for being very
um what's the word i guess like
focused on information heaviness and
less on just
ui and aesthetics yeah and it just needs
to it just
they needed simplification for people to
be able to like know how to use it
right i also found weirdly that big sur
also had a lot of elements
that looked like they belonged maybe not
on a phone but at least on a touch
screen yeah like big touch targets
sliders things that are like way bigger
than they used to be
yeah felt less like a computer and i
wonder if that's
kind of in the same vein they're like oh
well there's gonna be young people who
are used to ipads we'll make it look
kind of like an ipad or are there future
things in mind i don't really know
um centered start menu good bad
totally okay i haven't gotten used to it
yet personally uh i keep going to the
left you can move it
right so you can move to the left if you
want i'm trying to get used to it before
i move it
yeah um it's a little bit weird i do
like that
the icons come up from the center it
feels more like
it's being you know birthed from the
center
that's maybe a weird term but like yeah
everything like comes out of the center
instead of having to like look around
your screen
it was a it was a big focus of the event
of like this whole centered theme
yeah it's like it's gonna it's not only
the center of the screen but like it's
the center of your life
and it's the center of your environment
and windows is now the center of this
like
ecosystem yeah i feel at home oh man we
should have had panos on that windows 10
home
yeah no it's it it makes sense to me
anytime i go to windows i just hit the
windows button on the keyboard so it
would just be an aesthetic change for me
instead of mousing to the corner i would
just hit the button and be like oh it's
in the middle
but yeah you know it's a small thing to
get used to for the last like year or
two they've been updating their
icons to yeah basically get ready for
this
and their new icon design i think is
really good it's very specific
very like you don't really get it
confused with any other
icons yeah i like it yeah me too i like
it this the new store icon
but also speaking of the store uh that
was one of the biggest most interesting
parts of
their announcement yeah and i we should
talk about it for a second so
you can now this is the headline you can
now run android apps
on windows 11. oh cool great i don't
know if i'm gonna do that but
like okay you know makes sense lots of
people who are used to a certain number
of apps they want to bring them
everywhere they go they can now use them
on their windows pc
neat um the the subtext to that headline
is inside of the windows store the way
this is going to work
is microsoft has partnered with amazon
and amazon's android app app store which
is not the same as the play store it's a
it's a big overlap but it's an
amazon app store will surface results
inside of microsoft store yep
so you have to want to search in the
windows store in the microsoft store for
apps
and then when you do step one yeah when
you do you'll find some android apps in
there let's say you want to install one
if you do you'll have to be signed into
your amazon account and you'll have to
have the amazon
app store app on your pc yeah so once
that is all done then you can download
apps that were built for
arm chips and android and touch screens
and put them on your pc
uh do you care at all about this this is
going to try it i'm not saying there's
so many thoughts about this i i tweeted
about this
because i was really like this feels so
hacky and convoluted
and it kind of goes back to
we use computers differently than we use
phones right when you have a phone
you're used to going to the app store
downloading an app like
you don't side loading apps you can do
on android
but you only would really do it if like
you're either trying to get it for free
or you'd normally have to pay for it
um not this is not legal advice yeah
um i shouldn't actually do that but yeah
um
or if you it was like taken off of the
play store or something and you wanted
to get it
yeah um that's pretty much the only i do
that all the time stands yeah
yeah so the whereas on my computer
yeah side loading on a computer is
basically the default
like you download apps from websites
yeah it's a different interesting
behavior i'm trying to think of all the
apps that i typically install like when
i set up a new computer
whether it's a mac or a windows machine
i don't really go
to the actual store very much now on a
mac i do a little bit more yeah there's
a little bit better curation and
i get slack and my to-do list and you
know final cut and tweetbot all from the
store
but when i'm setting up a windows
machine i'm going to the browser for
pretty much everything every first slack
for that app for spotify for that app
for you know my to-do list for the app
all these are things that i'm
downloading from the web
and i don't really go to the microsoft
windows store
so is this an effort i guess for them to
like make you more comfortable with the
store get you
using the store more even though they
don't want it to take over the whole
experience 100
i think so because like like i said
before um you know we're so used to like
just going to an app store on our phones
whereas on our computers and you said
like
yeah you maybe will download some apps
off of the mac app store
you still can download most apps from
the
website right you still can yeah and
even on android
uh way back in the day when you go to
amazon.com it would be like
hey we have a free app of the week on
the amazon app store you should
sideload the and like they encouraged
you to
sideload another app store on your phone
which now
seems like weird you would think google
would get really mad about that
um that might be an antitrust thing i'm
not sure but
like the fact that you had to side load
the amazon app store
onto your android phone in the past and
they would kind of just like
copy as many apps from the play store as
they could onto the amazon app store
yeah and now you have to do that on your
computer
it just feels so hacky one and then
two i really dislike that you need to
have now a microsoft account
and an amazon account to be able to run
android apps like like it's more of a
it's more about principle like we all
have both
accounts yes and it's fine yeah but like
the same way you needed a facebook
account
to use an oculus rift yeah i don't want
both exactly
okay and and then the other thing is
that um we've tried
you know running mobile apps on on
screens that were not made for mobile
apps chrome os supports android apps
i like that for some reasons because i
never use them
yet the only thing i really use that for
was being able to upload photos
to instagram from my laptop which you
can actually do in chrome if you emulate
a
tablet a mobile device yeah okay but if
you like edit on your pc then you want
to just upload yeah
there are some like edge cases
but but at the same time like the
experience of using a mobile app on
anything but a mobile device is really
bad
yeah yeah it's not great like he showed
tick-tock on the screen
and they just showed tik-tok open but i
was like go ahead try to scroll yeah you
don't have a touch screen
go ahead and you're on the mouse like
you know it's like not
an ideal experience yeah all these apps
are built for
finger input so trying to replicate that
with the touch pad
on various windows laptops will be
various different experiences
so it is what it is but i did see you i
think it was confirmed you'll be able to
sideload android apps i think straight
up apk is
right into windows 11 which is pretty
cool which is nice
so if i find like a dark sky clone
somewhere on the dark web i can
install the apk yeah uh but
that is that is the state of yeah the
new store on windows 11.
i just i don't know what android apps
that you would want to run on a
computer that you couldn't there isn't a
better alternative that you can just
download from a website
you know and like i definitely think
that this is a move
for microsoft to get more people
comfortable with the windows store
because they can take more revenue if
you buy games directly off of the
windows store
than if you you know buy it on steam
they don't get revenue from that
yes although they they did make a pretty
big point in their presentation about
like the choice developers have now
where you can go through microsoft and i
think they take a 15
cut so or you can use your own payment
system and they don't take a cut at all
right and they set it on stage yeah
because
now that everybody knows apple's taking
a 30 cut that's sort of a big deal
yeah so yeah just making developers
comfortable making users comfortable
checking out how great this windows
store is
it is really it is really interesting
because like i want to immediately
dismiss the idea that people will ever
use the windows store at all
ever because i have never used it at all
ever and i
don't plan to but that said like i said
with like
pre like newer generations being more
used to at the idea of app stores
yeah if they come onto windows devices
and there is an app store maybe
they'll default to that versus the side
loading of downloading something from a
website yeah
and it'll have all the apps they already
know yeah and the other thing is that
like windows 11 is very geared towards
like they made a big deal of it being
very touch screen friendly
right and this concerned me a little bit
because uh if we remember windows 8 it
was
overtly touch screen friendly so much so
that desktop users got
really put to the it was built for touch
screen it was built for touchdown
tiles and everything yeah they made a
big deal of this also being more built
for touch screens
i think it's a better kind of like uh
balance because they just made the touch
targets bigger and
like the ui doesn't actually really
change when you switch to touchscreen
mode
but it is easier to use so
it's a good balance i'm just a little
bit worried that they're going to like
fall back into that cycle of like bad
windows good winners bad windows good
ones
so i i agree i think they're they did
make a nicer balance i think i hope
they've learned their lesson
like if we went to windows 8 and then
they got right to 8.1 like they made the
changes they had to
yeah so i feel like yeah we have bigger
touch targets but it does still look
like
windows as far as i can tell and i'm
sure we'll find out more as this comes
out
eventually by the end of the year i
guess but uh
yeah i think that the last bit about
windows 11 i want to talk about was the
the confusion about what computers can
actually
update to windows 11 because there's a
certain chip now it was a mess
i guess can we break it down as simply
as possible there's a chip
yeah that is in most modern pcs that
is required to run windows 11 yeah and
if you i think a lot of people just
don't know if they have the chip or not
or they've realized that their like
three-year-old laptop
doesn't have the chip or it isn't
enabled and you have to go into the bios
and enable it and then it'll work
yeah um i think a compatibility checker
that handles all this stuff would be
great if it just
had blanket they have they have it okay
it was broken for the first about week
right
so so it's like the this chip is called
a tpm chip it's a security module chip
that is supposed to handle like
lower level security stuff microsoft
said you needed a tpm 2.0 chip which
only came out like three years ago
uh and actually in the system
requirements it said
2.0 but it's not actually required 1.2
is required which came out a long time
ago
okay almost every computer has a 1.2
chip
um the problem is the compatibility
checker
was like no it was broken for multiple
reasons like
for one reason it was saying you need a
two when you actually only need a 1.2
and then the other thing was the bios
thing whereas like i think
they're like you would you would think
that maybe
everyone that wants to get on the
insider build or like
the like beta build of windows 11 would
know how to
do stuff with their bios i don't think
that's the case this is not the case
there's a difference between beta
testers and people that are like willing
to like
get really into the wheels the bios and
everything
yeah which is it's a scary thing to do
yes you can really mess up your computer
yeah so all right well i hope i hope it
gets simplified in the future i'm
looking forward to more testing of
windows 11
yeah segway time speaking of
uh 11
wow i i don't know you're gonna
but well the xperia one mark three has
nothing to do with eleven
well it has a one and it has a one in
there three ones
it doesn't have a two one so the name is
two elevens but then
one of the it gets it left anyway it
walked away
okay the review of the sony experiment
iii is now live on the channel
and i wanted to shout that out because
this i'm gonna hold it up right now this
has got to be the most oddly put
together set of
flagship parts i've ever seen yeah it it
is it becomes
uber enthusiast it's like a really good
phone yeah i really enjoyed using this
phone except for the one weird auto
rotate bug
um but i just want to just go over from
the top to the bottom
every weird decision they've made about
this file yeah sure and why it just
seems like it's
it's geared to be the lowest selling
best phone they've ever made
okay number one the name it's the sony
xperia one
three okay yep that's just good luck
explaining that
it's you can say mark three yeah you can
say it's the the third
one whatever you want to say it's not a
great name
yeah um but there it is sony xperia one
mark three
two this phone was announced in april
and it's been
under embargo for a while since then
i've had this phone for about a month
yeah i got the phone and typically this
is what happens we get a phone for
review and it's like all right
well when does it actually get like
unveiled when is the embargo up it'll be
in a week or so and we'll have that
amount of time to play with the phone
sometimes it's two weeks
nice this one it was like five weeks
we're like okay
this is what happens is it gets
announced it has some cool features and
then slowly the hype
drains and the attention span forgets
yeah and then it quietly launches
a month later no one buys it so yeah it
is out now
um yeah the screen the screen is the
next one
so this is a high-end phone it's got a
snapdragon triple eight 12 gigs
of ram android 11. but this screen is a
21x9 4k oled
at 120hz so
it's a battery burner it definitely
burns through battery but it's 4k
all the time and you cannot change the
resolution
and that to me is kind of crazy you can
change the refresh rate
between 60 and 120. um would you even
want a 4k phone
or it's one of those things that like
they have those
compatibility not compatibility checkers
but they have these grids
online that you can look up that's like
what resolution do you need
for how far away you are from your
device
and it's usually for tvs and it's like
you only need 4k
if you're sitting up this close because
then you'll start to see the pixels
your phone is like six inches from your
face yeah so so i think that's why
apple did the whole retina display thing
was because like look you're here um
you know it's like at least you can
toggle the 4k
mode on in youtube and know that it's
giving you all the pixels
okay yeah um but it
it just feels like something they felt
like they needed to do because they have
the bravia line of tvs
i would be fine with it it's just you
can't turn it down yeah like
sony put a 1440p screen in a lot of
their phones and
at any point you can just switch it to
1080p mode and you'll save battery life
you'll save power you're pushing less
pixels performance will be better and
you just know you have the ability to do
that at any time
if you want 1440 turn it back up now you
can watch the video at full res
this phone is 4k yeah which would be a
great
option but you cannot turn it off yeah
and i wonder if they'll add that with a
software update or whatever but i mean
it's a great looking screen but like you
said if you're looking thinking about
retina display
um that's like 250 to 350 ppi is like
pretty good
yeah this is a 640 plus ppi
that's insane like yeah yeah i got i
mean i got to say like i do appreciate
high density displays i remember when
the lg g3 came out
and it was like it was the forced 1440p
phone
and it just blew my mind and they had
all of these demos built into the phone
that would just be like 1440p video and
you could show your friends and it was
amazing
um and i like 1440p phones i just find
it hilarious because like
samsung for example who like when the
ultra came out
everyone was like oh but i want to run
you know 1440p at 120 hertz and they're
like
aha you can't do that you can run 1080p
at 120 hertz or you can run 1440p at 60
hertz
and yet sony's just like you will run 4k
4k all the time at 120 hertz no choice
oh my gosh and you're gonna like it too
yeah
uh yeah no this is a is a really
interesting choice and we'll see if that
ever changes
but then also okay this phone also has a
but it's a nice design it's matte black
it's kind of like soft touch it's pretty
squared off but it's got a
ton of like these niche features that
you just don't see combined to phones
nowadays yeah one headphone jack yeah
wow they added that in the two by the
way in the xperia one one
they didn't have it 11 windows 11. um
and the experiment they didn't have it
which was like
you know sony this is your chance yeah
exactly so they added it back yes it's
still here yeah
uh there's this really nice haptic motor
and this like
sync where it'll like sync to the beat
of your music and vibrate the music
which is
yeah xperia xz2 they added that and it's
kind of ridiculous but whatever
it works yeah it's a powerful motor i
dislike when there's like a weak
vibration motor and you're like yes
calls because of it yeah
tool-less sim card tray sony's always
had this and
it's so underrated for tech reviewers so
happy
like i know people generally don't care
but it's so nice and especially because
they also have dual sim and a micro sd
card slot micro sd card expansion
yes so you can add up to a terabyte of
storage via micro sd
that's a dying breed how many dying
breed things we have in here there's a
led notification light on this phone
yeah
you really don't see that very well i
remember when i had to like run
cyan engine mod on my galaxy
nexus 6 to be able to enable the the led
notification oh
yeah because it had one but it didn't
talk to any apps yeah yeah yeah that was
a weird time that was weird like they
were going to use it and then they
scrapped it but you could like get it
back if you ran your own custom wrong
yeah and then it would glow like green
for text and yellow for twitter and like
yeah first whatever like that's that was
cool um
this phone's got custom buttons okay so
all the way on the right hand side
power button and fingerprint reader
volume rocker up here which is nice
custom single button down here just for
google assistant yes
very nice give me that very nice i kind
of wish there was a software toggle to
continually make that whatever i want
but yeah i would have made it assistant
anyway so cool
yeah and then a separate camera toggle
yeah
with a half press for focus and a full
press to launch
or take photos and videos that is all
like very unusual to find in any other
phone out there right now yeah
but i think the camera is where it gets
the weirdest yeah
so we've got triple cameras on the back
uh a regular an ultra wide and a
telephoto yep but the telephoto
has two different focal lengths and this
was a we were trying to figure out how
they did this
or you know what exactly is happening
inside the phone
there are some sony videos on their
youtube channel where you can see it's
it's a periscope type lens so it's
sideways inside the phone
but there are glass elements moving
inside the phone so it'll snap
between 70 millimeters and 105
millimeters yeah
in practice it's not actually that big
of a difference in zoom that's
like a 1.3 x
or whatever you want to call it but it
was just fascinating
that it would actually do that and they
actually spent the time
to engineer such a unique solution
inside the phone
yeah um do you think this has a future
do you think this could be
built by other companies do you think
they'll keep doing this yeah i could i
could see it as being
a thing for sure i think optical
telephoto lenses
are very important because like software
is fine when you have really high
resolution sensors and we do have really
high resolution sensors but again
you have all of these problems with
higher resolution sensors in smartphones
because
like sure but they're not big enough and
then when you do make them big you have
a very
small plane of focus yep what sony was
trying to do with
with this and they started this in
xperia one two i believe was like they
want to have the holy trinity of lenses
which is a 16 to 24 a 24 to 70 and a 70
to 200.
okay and so the idea is that there's a
16 there's a 24 and then in the mark
ii there was a 70 and you could zoom you
could do software crop
between them yeah this one i think
they're just trying to give you as much
optical capability as possible i love it
yeah i think it's a great idea but i get
a little nervous about this
for two reasons one um
i don't so i was i talked about this in
the review video but what samsung did
with
dual aperture yeah where they they had a
really good idea they were like okay we
would like to be able to close down
aperture because you can get more in
focus you can take sharper photos
there's all sorts of useful applications
of it and
in the galaxy s9 they had either a wide
open or stop down i forgot what the
f-stop was yeah but like 4.4 or
something yeah versus like 1.8 or
whatever wide open
and you could see it like snap close
snap open and they
they built that under the phone and i
was like that is super cool literally a
variable aperture
in our main smartphone camera yeah and
the next year was gone
yep and they never did it again and
really usually you really could have
used it because there's phones like the
s21 that have the ultra
shallow depth of field where if you
could just stop down to f4
like every photo in daylight would look
better so
the fact that they never brought it back
despite being super useful it makes me
nervous that this might never show up in
another phone again yeah it's just a
gimmick
nobody's gonna buy the phone sony's
gonna realize all the r d money was for
nothing and then it's gone
yeah so i'm nervous about that it might
happen it might not
um but the other thing is like it's it's
not that great of a
camera set yeah it's a you know sony's
made like
great improvements with their software
and obviously sony makes alpha cameras
and they've
made really good cameras in the past and
so this is really good fast
focus and really cool having a dedicated
shutter button and all
the advanced modes and everything 20 fps
burst mode it's great
i never miss a shot there's like no
shutter lag but then the shot i get is
like
yeah a little too shallow a little bit
muted
so it is what it is the phone itself
though uh
very nice i'll show this on the podcast
even though i did it already
on the video uh world's slowest auto
rotate i've never seen anything like
this
in any other phone ready
wow it takes a good four seconds
yeah it's a we actually timed it
yesterday on average it was almost three
and then one time it took seven yeah and
as a person i know not everybody some
people just lock auto rotate and never
use and don't care but as a person who
does rotate stuff all the time i watch a
lot of videos
it got very annoying yeah something to
keep an eye on maybe they'll fix that
with software but
sony xperia one mark iii hundred bucks
if you can get over that
then you'll have the world's maybe not
the world's first
variable aperture or variable zoom but
yeah
a couple really impressive things 4k
screen and a nice smooth android
experience
yeah yeah they're good their ui is
really good i think i think we were
talking about this yesterday it's like
i think the s like the s21 ultra 1200
dollars is a best
a better overall package for people who
care about the things that most people
care about
yeah but if you're like a hardcore just
like i want the best
everything yeah then like these are
really good phones
yeah i would say i would argue the s21
ultra for the same price will give you
all better cameras yeah they would give
you a better screen despite not being 4k
because it's bigger much brighter yeah
they would give you better software
they would give you better battery life
they would give you faster charging
and they'd probably give you more
software updates but if you care about
the things that sony does yeah you care
about the dual stereo front-facing
speakers yeah which is the
expandable storage that samsung doesn't
have the headphone jack the led
notification light like all these crazy
enthusiast things
it's your boy i always used to say the
xperia ones are the r slash android
phone
yeah that's what's gonna happen we
haven't uploaded the video yet as of the
recording of this now but this is
this is where i expect people to care
about this phone cool
so did you see the boss dynamics new
video on their youtube channel it did i
love these videos yeah i gotta say
and it gets a mixed reaction in the
studio i have it here in the notes that
i think adam wrote this is how the world
ends
i i'm not so down on these i'm kind of
into the idea of like robots being able
to do
all sorts of crazy things so i'm just
going to describe the video
real quick for those who are listening
uh picture spot the boston dynamics
robot
that we've done a video with with a
about a three foot goose neck robot
attachment
that that yeah the neck attachment one
is the one that freaks me out the most
yeah it's kind of it looks like it's a
it's like a face on top of the robot
on a neck and then picture like seven of
them
all doing a choreograph dance extremely
precisely i might add with like
obviously very robotic movements but
also like a pretty good amount of rhythm
yeah so yeah good for them this is like
i tweeted about this i was like this is
a this is a whole job
yeah like it's somebody's job at boston
dynamics
to choreograph a dance they they get
probably free access to like i'm gonna
need seven robots this week and
a bluetooth speaker and i'm gonna make
something happen yeah and then they get
to do it
what were your thoughts watching the
video when we first saw it i always
they're they're fun
they're definitely very fun yeah um i
think they're
equally equally scary come on
i i look if you've seen black mirror
okay like there's an episode and they've
referenced this before
where they have robotic dogs who are
chasing down people in like a
post-apocalyptic
world and i i think the stuff that these
robots can do is insane and like they
have the humanoid ones too that dance
and they're
it's they can do freaking like backflips
the humanoid ones are a little creepy
yeah a little bit
they're very robocop so here's why i'm
not creeped out really by them
uh-huh is because i know that they are
all
programmed to do exactly what they're
doing
like when we go in to do a robot shot
with mia like obviously mia doesn't look
like it doesn't have these
anthropomorphic features like it doesn't
have arms and legs
like like spot the dog or like the
upright one wherever
whatever it's called atlas or atlas yeah
um
so it's mia so it just sits there
holding a camera but it only does
exactly to the t what we just told it to
do and only does it when we tell it to
do it right
yes so even though it looks
anthropomorphic like a dog with a neck
dancing in front of me in
synchronization it would be very creepy
if they decided to do that by themselves
yeah but i know watching that that a
very skilled programmer is responsible
for starting all the moves at the same
time and building the moves so that it
looks like they're doing it in sync
that's the most impressive part to me is
someone had to decide like
on beat like how i'm gonna make this
robot move to make it look like it's
dancing so i see that i'm like wow good
for the program like
that's awesome what i said in slack is
will you be saying the same thing when
it's dancing on your grave i do
i just don't i i see the move and i'm
like wow that's
very cool but there's there's no way it
does things it's not programmed to do
and like that was a really funny michael
reeves video we've talked about before
where he like
programmed it to like find a bucket and
pee in it
because it had like you know all these
sensors he put attached to it like
that's funny
but yeah it only does what you're what
it's probably yeah i mean i think like
the the i the dancing is fine right the
dancing is great and i think that
because they're so precise like michael
even said like
this is cg right because their precision
and their timing with each other is so
exact that it almost feels
fake because human movement is so
not perfect yeah if you've ever seen
like synchronized
uh swimmers or synchronized dancing or
whatever there's always just a tiny
little bit of
yeah like and your subconscious will
notice that yeah i wonder if they'd
programmed a slight delay
or a slight variance if that would have
been more
realistic looking i don't know if they
want the realism though it's like it's
like when spot
is in his like default mode and he's
doing the thing with his legs where he's
just going back and forth
it like doesn't feel right it's really
precise it's so precise
yeah yeah i don't know i i i enjoy it
and like
i i think these are great demos of like
keeping yeah it keeps them in the news
it's good pr
and it's just it's just more friendly
things that the robot can clearly do
i think one of the things we were
wondering about is like
does does boston dynamics have the
biggest delta between
how good their image can be and how bad
their image could be
probably because because you know once
in a while you get a weird headline of
like here's the police using a robot dog
in new york city and you're like
what i've seen this robot dance now it's
like guarding like i don't like it i
don't like that
like don't don't combine those things
yeah so yeah i think they
they keep themselves in a pretty good
eye yeah and it's it's
clearly gets more capable every year
like if you look if you scroll down on
their youtube channel look at their old
videos
yeah they probably those things like
crap now they look
rough yeah in the past then no pun
intended yeah
yeah uh so i'm happy for them yeah no i
mean um and hyundai bought them now
that's something i don't know if we
talked about yet yeah that was the the
last weird part of this
was uh it was a bbc
and i was trying to figure out why on
earth they chose that
um bts the the band the k-pop band
collabs with a bunch of other korean
tech companies all the time they collab
with samsung all the time yeah all the
time
and so that was the connection is uh
hyundai's korean hyundai
just bought boston all of the company
you're a stake in it
them if not probably a majority
stakeholder yeah which is kind of crazy
because like they were owned by
google for a while and then softbank
bought them from google and now
softbank sold it to button to hyundai
so now they're obviously pretty tight
with hyundai they have 80 percent
okay yeah so yeah that's so hyundai's
like yeah we'll do
a bts dance video with the robots that's
that's the natural thing we do to
celebrate because we live in the future
now
yeah so it's beautiful yeah yeah
uh i just okay just like don't put guns
on the dogs and then we'll be okay
that's the only thing i think there's a
department
at boston dynamics in charge of making
sure no one does anything
too crazy yeah sure yeah for now
all right well now we have some we have
some patreon some creator economy news
to talk about
now i like to think i'm i'm pretty
plugged into the creator economy i've
talked to a lot of fellow creators and
obviously we
we have internal dialogues and
discussions about this stuff all the
time
um but we have a note here that jack
conti the ceo of patreon right
creator of patreon um did an interview
with neil i
on the decoder podcast i haven't
listened to it yet but you have
but there are some notes about some
things he brought up
on the creator the creator economy and
stuff he talks about with uh
the 30 apple tax yeah you want to break
it down yeah so
so if you've been following um the news
with
especially with epic and apple uh
basically
apple will take 30 of any transaction
that is made
uh through an app that is on their
platform
basically and they got mad at epic
because epic was trying to sell fortnite
skins
with like a workaround way so that apple
didn't get the 30
cut yep apple says well we're providing
both the service the giant platform that
basically created
the the entire app market and
also we have all these like security and
safety protocols involved to make sure
that you're safe and you don't get
malware and we have to protect our users
and that just kind of created this whole
conversation on like
what do platforms like what are they
owed
you know google takes like 30 as well
and so that kind of created this whole
antitrust thing
and now like we talked about earlier
microsoft
made a point it was almost a digital
with windows 11 on the windows store
saying we're not going to take any money
if you have your own platform you know
payment system
yeah and now i feel and like facebook's
doing the same thing like they just
released their own like newsletter
service
and they're doing a similar thing where
like until you make a certain amount of
money
it's gonna be you're gonna get all the
revenue like so now it almost seems like
people are competing
for we're giving creators as much
possible um like revenue from what
they're making as possible
music to my ears yes yeah competition is
good competition is good
that's actually a main point that jack
was making um
in the decoder podcast was neil i was
saying was talking about like this
anti-trust stuff
he's like what do you think about it and
and jack was like well
you can kind of see like as more
platforms
compete with each other to give creators
more revenue because like
creators are the content and
content is king and when you are
providing
all of the content for a service like
you think about twitter if twitter navi
users
it wouldn't be a product yeah i think
about this all the time
uh we use the word platform yeah and
when i think of a
physical platform a platform is
raised up above the wrist and so
something being
on that platform gives it a visibility
it wouldn't have if it wasn't on the
platform
and so if you think of something like
twitter for example as a platform
it's like okay yes if i just want to
share my thoughts about
bacon whatever i could just write them
and email them to a bunch of people and
then hope they
share that and then you know it is what
it is
maybe only five people read it but if i
tweet it
that platform could rise it to people
searching for tweets about bacon or
people who follow
my account or people who share things
with other enthusiasts about bacon
the point is the platform is benef
is a benefit to everyone on it yeah the
other half of that
is the platform is nothing without the
stuff on it yeah
so if your twitter if no one tweets yeah
it's not much about what is
what is your service exactly so you can
build an amazing platform and discovery
but you need
the content creators to actually
complete the cycle and make this thing
work so yeah youtube is
another huge example which is like
totally if you want to make videos
on the internet that people see there is
only really one place
that you can guarantee the maximum
number of people see it and that's
youtube
and so youtube's in this phenomenal spot
where it's like hey we
are the reason people see your stuff
yeah but on the other hand
creators of that content are the only
reason youtube got to where it is today
yeah
so i think about that dynamic a lot and
i'm curious if you know how patreon
sort of fits in as a puzzle piece of
that yeah i think the dynamic has
shifted a lot
uh first of all because this idea of
like creator economy didn't really used
to be a thing this idea that like
everyone is a creator everyone is unique
everyone is kind of a product
the words have been said a lot in the
last year or two yeah
it's blown up a lot because i think in
the past these services saw themselves
as like
hey we're a product you're going to use
our product and like
the creators or the ind or people that
have twitter accounts are just
using the product but there there wasn't
this mindset
shift of like oh the people on your
platform
are making the platform make you money
right
and so now because more people are
become are coming online more people are
becoming more creative and like trying
to market themselves as
creatives and drawing more people to the
platform
more creatives are kind of like
demanding
not demanding necessarily but like
needing
more revenue from the things that they
are helping the service they are helping
lift up right yeah
like you said if youtube didn't have
like these big channels
then they wouldn't really be a platform
but anyway the whole patreon thing
really interesting because patreon's
been around for a very long time yep
um jack conti was very early to this and
i've listened to like every interview
that he's ever done i've listened i've
like watched all his videos
and he's been like beating this drum
forever that like eventually we're gonna
get to this point
where everyone can make a living doing
what they love
because of scale because when you have
the internet
and you have like a thousand people that
like love what you do
if they will give you a dollar a week
which is very little for them like
we have this idea of like subscription
service and like
over saturation slash anxiety with
youtube premium and like hbo max and
like
sure uh but we're kind of tailoring our
lives now
to everything being a subscription
service the cool thing though about are
we doing that on purpose or is that just
the way the world is i think it's
just the way the world's shifting i
think there are benefits to it it's like
if you subscribe to a cable subscription
before but you only watch two channels
yeah why are you paying 30 when you can
pay two dollars right you know so it's
like
so you're sort of you're we're breaking
down like more individualized
subscriptions
instead of just like you know instead of
icloud plus or whatever it's called with
10 different services
i'm going to pay for just the two or
three things i need right and i'm
overall going to benefit more from
penguins right right okay but now
if you're like a super fan of something
right and you like you want you just
want to
absorb and eat up everything that that
creator is making whether it's music
whether it's videos whether it's
you know podcasts like anything you're
able to
throw a dollar five dollars at somebody
so you allow
a lot yourself like a 300 budget for
like
subscription entertainment and it
because of scale
because the internet is so massive and
you can allot
so many fans so quickly as a creator
even if only a thousand people you have
a thousand
core audience members which is fairly
easy to get now right like
in the past that was very difficult now
it's pretty easy to get a thousand
people to give you
one dollar like a month or a week
interesting yeah
you can like make your living you can
exist as a human because everyone is
trading money around in micro doses
right
i think that yeah the the fact that we
see so many more subscriptions
out there now is probably a big reason
for this like i think jack probably
seemed pretty early because back then it
was like
if i pay 10 a month for netflix
why would i give any one person five
dollars
right what how could they possibly
create that much value for that one
netflix
is ten dollars a month right but now
there's so many different things that we
pay a subscription fee for
not just cable but like i pay for
youtube tv
i also pay for youtube premium i also
pay for spotify that's like nine ten
dollars a month i also pay for
this and that and there's als there's
like all these different subscriptions
that i think
deliver their value basically per month
and
a lot of those may be creators whose
youtube channels i've subscribed to and
have joined the the club on
yeah like i paid them a couple bucks a
month yeah and that's because i'm not
just supporting them but i'm getting
more out of it
and so now there are so many
subscriptions happening
that it's a more natural reaction to be
totally willing to pay
one to five dollars a month to an
individual because
we're just doing that all the time now
yeah so yeah that 300 bucks
a month budget probably seemed a little
high back in the day
today probably seems pretty real because
if you break it down like in the past
like
a lot of that was going towards your
cable bill and you only use two of those
channels and if you can
break down everything into just like
micro payments you're gonna still be
paying a similar amount of money but
it's just more tailored to you
there's a more personal like i am
helping this creator make a living
like it feels very personal it's a
connection there there's a connection
there
um and and also i think people are
starting to realize like
coffee costs five dollars and i get that
every day you know and it's like true
what what is the value of one cup of
like just not getting a coffee one day
and then i can pay five creators
yeah it's so funny it's like pretty dope
when you like compare the value of
things like
if i pay 10 a month for netflix and i
pay how much if you
if you buy a five dollar coffee twice a
week every month that's
40 that's that's a lot more than that oh
yeah what am i getting out of this
coffee
exactly so yeah maybe netflix seems
underpriced now instead of overpriced
yeah
the point is yeah we the creator economy
thing i think
you know i've i don't really talk about
it that much but i feel like the
the scale of things the way they've
ballooned over time
makes things like youtube feel more like
a fabric that we exist in
rather than like a structure of a
platform where now
uh yeah anyone who shares something that
they
love or something that they make can
accumulate enough
people who will just be within this
fabric and drawn to that thing
yeah that they can eventually make that
what they do yeah that's it like before
like tv
super structured to me like there are
channels and there are shows
and there are ad slots that support the
channels and the shows and
everything is very much like what's on
amazon it's built a certain way yeah and
if you
want to be a tv news anchor and that's
what you want to do
then there's a path you follow and then
if you land here at this company then
you can
you can be part of this structure
exactly where
on youtube it's like i don't really have
to pick a channel or
pick a news network i can just do what i
want to do yeah
and this fabric will sort of find you
instead of being siloed into these
things so we're all kind of connected in
that way
um just reachability too like remember
when gangnam style hit
it was the first billion dollar view
video billion views yep
sorry not billion dollars first video
with a billion views and it was fast too
it was like a month or two and but but
the when that happened all the headlines
were like oh my gosh
a video on the internet can get a
billion views how many videos have a
billion views now
a lot a lot because you've got this like
growing like there's a lot of kids now
that are just very online and they like
they use youtube as their main
entertainment source and
like you said it's become almost a
fabric of society and i was thinking
about this the other day like twitter
now is part of the fabric of society
like there are major
like nations make statements on twitter
that can affect
local global geopolitics and like all
this stuff
yeah crypto crypt
[Laughter]
um okay but bring bringing it back to
the point of this new story the point of
the decoder
episode that kind of like made the
reason this made headlines
was that okay so patreon is a very old
platform right it's been around for a
very long time it was like
really early youtube is like when
patreon got started and the cool thing
is like patreon got started just a
little background because
jack conti and his wife are musicians
and i i watched their videos yeah they
were on youtube
yeah yeah and they wanted to fund their
band
with they wanted their band to be like
their full-time thing but they're like
how do we do this
and jack had created this music video
that he put like blood sweat and tears
into he spent all of his money in his
bank account to make this music video
where he was like inside the millennium
falcon like he built a cockpit in his
garage
all of this stuff and he was just like
this is so unsustainable because i got
he got a million views on youtube with
that video which is amazing
but he got like 300 in revenue
and he spent multiple thousands so he
was like
i want to do music full time how do i do
this and he came up with this idea of
creator economy that it's he was so
early to it
but the point is he was so early and it
was very early in youtube
that like when you sign up for a patreon
page you're not
generally in the patreon app doing
discovery right because like
a lot of the reason that that apple or
google says you owe us 30
is because they're get they're creating
the discovery platform
whereas patreon is such a different
thing because when you subscribe to a
patreon
account it's not discovery based you
already know
that you really like this creator you're
willing to give them
three five ten dollars a month because
you wanna see extra content from them
you wanna have that personal
relationship with them and that's the
only reason you're on that site right
now exactly
it's it's not a discovery based platform
at all it's like
i love this person i want to give them
my money and so because of that
generally people signed up for patreon
accounts on the web
and so you would go on a website you go
to the specific patreon page
and you would say hey i'm gonna sign up
i'm gonna give you five dollars a month
now the they do have an app obviously
um but what neil i asked him was like
so is apple taking 30
of every patreon subscription because
like
you know if people like sign up in the
app
and uh because there was this whole
elite battle with spotify
where and netflix spotify and netflix
like
for a bit spotify offered hey if you
sign up for our account in the app it's
12.99 a month if you sign up on
spotify.com it's 9.99 a month right
literally
that's the difference and netflix i
believe still doesn't have you still
can't sign
up for a netflix account in the netflix
app right you have to go on the web
right for that reason so neil i was like
is apple taking 30
like how are you getting around that and
he was like um
no and so neil i was like that's weird
like why haven't they come after you yet
because there's actually this other
platform um that is
similar to patreon uh
where apple did go after them recently
and they're a very small company
so it's kind of weird that like patreon
hasn't been hit with this yet
yeah um jack conti has i don't i don't
know if he's
ready to face that legal challenge like
when eli brought it up he seemed like
a bit like i don't that's not really
something i want to deal with because i
just want to like help
people make money right um so
so yeah it's interesting and it's
basically going to be this thing of like
how hard is is apple gonna crack down
on all platforms you know gotcha
interesting yeah yeah i think part of
what we were saying too about that of
like
okay patreon is not necessarily a
discovery platform yeah this is
something
uh people talk about with only fans too
it's like
when you get to only fans someone else
funneled you there yeah it's not like
you're
i guess i don't know but i'm imagining
people aren't browsing around only fans
looking for things they're not browsing
around patreon
finding things it's because someone sent
them to their patreon yeah
so i wonder if the the ideal future of
something like patreon
is actually being more a part of the
fabric
of this discovery that we have on
youtube for example
now i don't know if they ever want to be
part of youtube
but wouldn't it be ideal if you could
say hey if you would like to support
what i do
there's a there's a couple buttons right
below this video for you to
just immediately like become a member
obviously youtube has channel
memberships already
but if you can really be off though
never really took off and i don't
i i don't know if there's any good
reason for it because it's kind of the
same thing yeah you've put
tiers in now different price levels
different rewards
but it's the same thing where it's like
you can you can be a part of
that discovery because youtube will send
you places based on where it thinks you
want to go yeah
and then when you arrive there you'll
have someone going hey if you like more
of what i do you can get more
you can support me here yeah yeah that
seems like actually an ideal
future i don't really know why it didn't
take off yeah it's strange
patreon specifically at the very end of
the podcast you mentioned that they
specifically don't
really want they don't want to be a
platform i think that's the difference
is that like like you said they're not a
discovery platform
they want to be like just a way for
creators to get
paid and because of that they don't
actually host content
they don't host video they don't host uh
like a
mail delivery service so like they
specifically partner
with these other platforms these other
services that creators are already using
so
when you have patreon exclusive video
content it's hosted through a vimeo
plugin
when you have patreon exclusive uh music
it's hosted through like a soundcloud
plugin
and you have patreon exclusive email
list it's hosted through
a mailchimp plugin like they do not
really host content they're just a way
for people to get paid and they wanted
to do that specifically because
it's as soon as you start hosting
content that all of this stuff gets
murky
right right there's a reason that like
there's all that um there's a lot of
discussion that like twitter needs to be
uh held accountable for what its users
post and that whole like section
the legal part yeah yeah yeah that's the
whole thing and so i think they're just
trying to avoid that because they're
just like we
really just want people to get paid yeah
i also think they might be incentivized
if if that was a part of their like new
business that say oh we'll do exclusive
content built into patreon
it would actually be good for their
business to shuffle people around
and discover other patreon things that
they can also subscribe to yeah so you'd
want people to
you eventually become a site that wants
people to stay on patreon as long as
possible
yeah to make patreon as much money as
possible because you're going and
bouncing around to different creators on
patreon
rather than just like this very direct
relationship between
the creator and one patreon site yeah i
do think they
understand that it's very difficult to
be like you might like
this person do you want to give them a
monthly fee of five dollars
yeah it's tough like we grew up in this
era where
like as soon as the iphone and the like
ipod touch came out
most apps were free so our generation is
not used to paying for online content
the music thing is the number one is
like the biggest shift i've seen i
remember back in the day on itunes
it was like i a new album comes out and
it's like all right
the whole album is 10 bucks but i only
like three songs from the album and i'm
going to buy these three songs for 99
cents each and they're in my library
and i make the tough choice of never
listening to any of the rest of those
songs again
which is a horrible idea by the way yeah
but oftentimes the first the songs you
hate the most
that's true end up being the best songs
on the album that's true but now
like if you bring that up to like my you
know teenage cousins they're like you
paid for
one song are you kidding you paid a
dollar yeah and
yeah so like now they're just so used to
being subscribed to apple music
subscribe to spotify where you have
access to a library for a fee and that's
the service you get for paying every
month
and the second you stop paying guess
what nothing is available to you
yeah and that's totally fine and that's
a that's a version that everyone is just
basically accepted at this point yeah um
so yeah i think we're just kind of
building off of that
like new philosophy of like yeah this
service provides value to me and the
second it doesn't anymore
i can just not have it anymore yeah
which i i think
is a good way forward there are a lot of
people that are very against not owning
what you
oh yeah what you view what you listen to
i totally totally understand that as
well
but in this world that is moving like so
internet focused that you don't really
need an office and a lot of for a lot of
jobs anymore
you can live anywhere you want just
being able to have
as much stuff digital as possible so
that you don't have as much
physical weighing you down i think is a
great thing yeah
here's a yeah here's a random question
to tie this up
for a subscription mindset yeah i was
gonna phrase it one way i'm just gonna
go to the extreme
okay would you pay a subscription
for access to your car
so instead of buying your car would you
pay
25 a month for a tesla model 3.
you mean a lease it's less than a lease
because you're just paying for access to
it
yeah it'd probably be more it would be
way more than 25 a month let's say
let's say 200 bucks a month for access
to the car and the second that you don't
pay it anymore you don't have it but
you can cancel at any time yeah you also
have to pay insurance would that be
worth it to you a thousand percent i i
mean personally
uh for people who know me i have major
commitment issues so
even getting an apartment was like
extremely
stressful for me because i love the idea
of just like one day i'm like you know
what
today i want to live in iceland oh so
it's an advantage for you to not have to
own it oh yeah
oh i see owning big physical things is
scary because i was going to say like
you own the car
would you pay 20 bucks a month for
autopilot and if you ever stop paying
then you don't have it anymore
and that's what they're gonna do that's
what they're gonna do and people really
don't like that it's like i
own my car it has software on it i own
the car
i use the software period yeah don't
make me pay over and over again for the
thing i already own and bought from you
but yeah if you just take it all the way
to the extreme of like
well you don't own your car but you can
use it like you own it until you stop
paying
yeah that would be fine i'd be fine with
not owning my car
i don't think a lot of people would i
don't think any everyone would the
autopilot thing
it again it's gonna depend on i know
this is a little like
we're going over here but this is like a
little bit like
autopilot right now cost ten thousand
dollars yep if they made it
30 bucks a month you're basically
weighing like
how long do i think i'm going to have
this car is this a bet is it a better
deal for me to have it temporarily yeah
will it affect the resale value all this
it's a math thing
but i i do think that a lot of people
are okay with like
paying very little amounts monthly
instead of paying a lot
now and then having this physical burden
on them yeah
yeah makes sense so anyway all right
well i think that's a good place to end
it we sort of talked about
a spectrum of things we hit the boston
dynamics thing we had xperia one mark
three we talked windows
11. yeah that's actually a lot of topics
it is kind of a
solid variety i didn't really have very
good segues today because they're
they're just not really
related in any good ways um but david
