all right what's going on everybody
welcome back to the waveform podcast
we're hosts i'm marquez and i'm andrew
and this is video episode number two
which is very exciting
i realized we just pointed to ourselves
and i was wondering why you're doing
that but just
that's because it's on video just so you
know i am marquez i'm pointing at myself
just in case you couldn't tell the
difference between us yeah actually
that's really funny because that brings
me right into we're going to talk about
a bunch of stuff today we've got some
electric car stuff we want to talk about
um some stuff going on with youtube and
some features and some feedback we might
have
and then also the world of like earpods
airpods for android
what's happening again it's great but i
want to go over some of my favorite
comments on
the first podcast video because now it's
on youtube it's on the waveform channel
you guys are watching it here again
uh if you're listening uh there's a lot
of great comments and obviously now that
we have youtube comments it's that
direct
direct feedback immediately i do wish
podcasts kind of had
a way to do that yeah i mean we've been
using the twitter kind of that way but
it's not as like
immediate and like time stamps and all
that stuff it's it's super good
um you might notice a little bit of a
theme here all right first one uh
i don't know why but after seeing this i
can't connect how andrew sounds to the
way he looks
i thought i wrote that at the end i
didn't know we were jumping into this
already it's great um
uh wait i have another one okay there's
a couple there's a couple like this
uh not gonna lie andrew's face is not
what i would have expected after
listening to his voice for all these
months
ever heard of how someone's face doesn't
match their voice that's andrew this is
my first time seeing his face i had no
clue what he looked like until now
and this isn't what i imagined no shade
andrew still cool as hell i apprecia i
appreciate the no shade disclaimer at
the end there
this is uh this is great this is the
beauty of of going on videos you
i i never pictured a lot of the audio
only podcasts
that i listen to i realized i was
reading a lot of these comments and
realizing like
i do the exact same thing reply all i
didn't
like look up what they looked like for a
long time every time i do
a like kind of uh criminal uh podcast or
something like that i refuse to look at
what anyone looked like until after the
end because i
usually i get so into it that i have the
pictures in my head and i don't want to
mess up that like my imagination like
when you read the book
after or when you see the movie after
you read the book and you're like that's
not how i pictured that character but
yeah all right all right so i'm sorry
for anyone who
i've my faces ruins your i'm dying to
know though like
i want to know what p how people saw me
in their head right
really bad my favorite comment i have no
explanation for this
but in my head after only hearing
andrew's voice i could swear he had long
hair
so yeah apparently that's how they'd
picture you is this is the longest my
hair has been in a bit but it's just
because i'm lazy
because i don't feel like getting it cut
i'm i don't have the patience for long
hair but
i'm kind of just hoping that means
you've got me as like a
fabio kind of vibe going on in your head
so
stop watching the video yeah i
appreciate that no imagine me like that
it's fun i i think the the point of the
video podcast i guess the whole point of
this is like we're
we're providing a little more uh context
like i
i didn't realize this but i watched a
bunch of video podcasts
before i'd gotten into the podcast world
and i realized that i wasn't really
watching them i was listening to them
but then glancing over every once in a
while when something was worth showing
or seeing
and that was why that's how i consumed
like the joe rogan podcast
or exactly or the h3 podcast or whatever
other they just kind of exist ambiently
and then i'll glance over like oh that
was kind of interesting
it's almost like you see it and you can
see how they're set up and it makes you
feel personal
and then all of a sudden you realize
you're not even looking at it anymore
but but you're still
almost imagining what exactly what's
already happening on the screen so yeah
i mean we did this as another
platform to have to have the podcast on
because people wanted it but our main
goal here and i know a lot of questions
um and comments we got were people
worried that the video podcast was going
to overshadow the audio
the audio format and we don't want that
to happen
at all it'll be the same experience
either platform
right minus video it's basically the
same yeah now one thing i will add
the clips channel will be much more
visual that if you haven't already seen
the clips channel or subscribe to it
might as well go subscribe now
uh the clips channel will have its own
clips and
parts of the podcast but like sectioned
out and
edited more into like their own videos
yeah and of course like you mentioned
this helps discover ability people can
find the podcast on youtube it's really
hard to just
discover podcasts unless they're
trending on apple podcasts so
that's what the channels are all about
definitely get subscribed on youtube if
you haven't already
that'll end my shameless plug well yeah
but i also think the clips channel if
you're an audio listener and at some
point
you think like oh like i wish i saw that
thing they were talking about because
they're terrible at explaining things
um verbally then you can just go find it
on the clips channel probably and it'll
be way easier to just
see that one little section maybe eight
to ten minutes of it
without having to like re-watch the
whole video podcast or something like
that
yeah cool also the intro is incredible
it's
almost michael just blew it up it's just
amazing and it's so easy that if you if
you have any reason to watch the videos
it's the intros are amazing
all right so this past week also on the
mkbhd channel you might have seen we
made a video on write to repair
mention that we're making a bigger piece
on waveform that is not this week we're
aiming for that to be
next week's waveform podcast with even
more interviews and even more opinions
and perspectives than before
so we're not talking about that this
week but that's upcoming stay tuned for
that it's gonna be good i'm excited for
that
yeah um but what i wanted to jump right
into is we finally have
and this is kind of all we have but we
have a name for ford's
electric f-150 pickup truck so it's
called the ford f-150
lightning and yeah that's kind of all we
know we don't really
know much about the details but i i kind
of have some thoughts about this i'm
curious what you think but
we there's like two categories of
names for electric cars there is
piggybacking on the established
already well-known name and then some
variation of it
mustang mock e tai can
turbo we know what porsche's turbo line
is so titan is
turbo right or we have like the totally
new name
because it's a cool new thing and we
have to
audi e-tron uh tesla's models for that
matter
or talk about another one exactly so
that
that's you know f-150 seems to make
sense because everyone knows ford f-150
ford f-150
deceivingly very popular in the us i
think it's the most popular
vehicle yeah a vehicle which is insane
so
i fully expect i would be shocked if
they didn't name it some variation of it
so lightning yeah
yeah lightning is like fine i guess i
don't
i'm not for or against it i think it 100
needed f-150 and
while like this kind of doesn't sound
like a lot of news we've heard so many
rumors about
ford in an f-150 line and like that
being we've heard a million
different pickups coming out and even gm
is jim part of rivian or
investing in ruby there's a bunch of big
investors in rivian
amazon okay amazon either way we
we were wondering when the f-150 comes
out because no matter how many cyber
truck and riviens and whatever there are
going to be
we all know the ford 150 is gonna be
like
that means pickup trucks made it to ev
because because of how popular it is and
this is one that
needed to keep its name it needed to
keep ford f-150
i kind of wonder if they decided to go
not with just
ev after it because nah they don't want
that
yeah they want that i don't know i think
okay so when they come out with this
truck because we don't know anything
else about it but i'm just gonna
i think this has to be better than the
current f-150
like especially in the things that could
matter for sure to convert and matter
because as soon you can picture this as
like if the f-150 lightning comes out
and it has poor range and worse towing
capacity than the normal f-150
oh yeah that will confirm to everyone
who had any reason to hate on evs or not
convert
that they should not upgrade to an ev
they shouldn't switch
yeah so i think you if you're for it and
i think they already know this but they
have to make
something about that truck obviously
better for pickup truck buyers i think
it's going to be towing capacity and
traction and power
because that's what these are good just
horsepower but the ability to tow way
more and carry more things
but i i look forward to seeing what they
actually make out of that
if i'm thinking about it right now like
so something i haven't really thought
about is like
there might even be that little added
benefit to being able to charge it home
because pickup trucks have such terrible
gas mileage like if you're just doing
your average commute not everyone in a
pickup truck is towing something every
single day
right so they still have to commute to
work i would love to just never have to
stop at a gas station because i'm sure
they're stopping it
on a like half an hour commute they're
probably stopping for gas
three times a week now you never have to
stop for gas on your regular commute
and instead just supercharge for maybe
some longer things
um that sounds great to me unless you're
traveling
all over the state because you do
construction and you have to go to a
million different sites
right then i see that as a drawback but
like just being able to plug it in every
night and never having to stop at a gas
station it's a huge win for a daily
driver i
i never even thought about this but like
you use the truck for work
and then you plug it in and you use your
home electricity on your like personal
bill
i feel like maybe there needs to be some
sort of established like
subsidy or like your work will pay for
this amount of your electricity bill
because it is amazing to wake up every
day on 100 battery like that's super
useful
but yeah that's probably an extra little
layer of consideration for like i
drive a work truck i need my work to pay
for
not the gas anymore but 50 bucks a month
on my electricity bill so when i wake up
in the morning i have 400 miles and i
just drive
so hopefully if you're at a good company
that'll be a pretty easy decision to
make between you but i i really do think
like
out of all the evs that have been
announced in the last
three years maybe i kind of think this
is
one of the most important if not most
hyped
if that makes sense because not
generally in the eevee world
but i think this has the most potential
to just like bring people
into the eevee world and we haven't seen
something like that in a long time
i know roadster has incredible specs i
know cybertruck is cool
you know taken is like a sports car
enthusiast but if we're talking about
pickup trucks
there are so many people with pickup
trucks because they just work
and they have a very specific purpose
yeah and if you're taking that most
popular one
if no matter if it's a pickup truck or
whatever you're taking the most popular
vehicle in a country and making a eevee
you're bringing people into the world
and i'm super excited about that
two things on that one they've gotta
nail the price i agree this will be
uh probably the most important ev
yet if they nail the price and if it's
not i think right off the bat
it will get insane yeah and two this is
something something i just thought of
also uh
maybe it's key advantages durability
because this is something uh tesla's
talked about a lot with the semi truck
is like
cost of operation per mile drops
dramatically when you don't have to
service it nearly as much like electric
vehicles don't so maybe
maybe that's the angle for the pickup
truck but you had another one on here
you wanted to talk about
yeah this is one uh i mean i've
mentioned it before i
i enjoy subaru as a car company a lot i
drive and present i love it even though
it's completely falling apart but that's
my fault and it has 170 000 miles on it
so i can't complain too much but
we've mentioned on here multiple times
that subaru seems like
the perfect car manufacturer to finally
make an ev because of how
environmentally focused they are they
announced it
the soltera ev so we were talking before
about
bringing in legacy cars and making a
eevee or a totally new name
soltera totally new name i believe and i
don't have the article in front of me
it is a mixture between the latin words
soul for sun yup and terra for land
yes cool so yeah look at me i know latin
earth wind and fire yeah no soltera
that that makes a lot of sense i i don't
think subaru is going to do
impreza eevee and expect that i would i
thought they would have done outback
evie because outback feels like their
most popular
it is an suv so the the picture is like
the typical
like yeah like what do we have we have
the name and a picture this time sort of
it's like the typical like launched
picture which is like here's the
headlights and the general outside of
the car
but like it's not a total silhouette but
very dark so you can't see and of course
it's driving in like the mountains by a
beautiful lake
sure um so it's gonna be an suv i think
it looks a little closer to a forester
which if you're not familiar
outback versus forester aren't that much
different forster's a little more suv
like has a taller hatchback and is a
little taller and shorter while
the outback stemmed from a station wagon
yeah and now it's built
up a bit so it's longer i think drives
more like a
to me sitting in it i feel like i'm
sitting high up like an suv but
long like my legs are out yeah like an
old station wagon but either way
it looks like this is closer to a
forester at least in size
i the thing is here's what's gonna
happen is it's gonna come out and
everyone's gonna go how does it compare
to tesla model y because it's just the
one that is the same size that
is the most popular that tesla makes
yeah and i
don't think that's the same customer
this is like a it's another one of those
things where
tycan had to get compared to model s but
like that's a different customer
and so subaru buyers who are looking for
eco-friendly plug
in literally in the garage every day but
also go for a long road trip that
they're going to care about charging
network
they're going to care about like price
friendly and that's
hopefully both going to be nailed by
this so yeah i'm kind of interested in
it because subaru's main like strong
points
are generally reliability which
hopefully they can continue to do that
yeah
all-wheel drive which i kind of think is
where they're not going to be able to
like
set apart quite as well because in
cheaper cars
all of their cars have all-wheel drive
and that's usually more expensive
so that's where they really set their
self apart in
combustion engine cars but here almost
every
every ev has four-wheel drive at this
point it didn't always it wasn't always
that way not always yeah
it used to be like there was the tesla
model s p85
and then they made the p85d which was
the dual motor because they had a bunch
of rear wheel drive
just single motor between the back
wheels now i don't think tesla
makes any single motor cars i think this
cyber truck might have a single motor
version
okay but that might not even be true i
think all of the all of their cars are
all-wheel drive
and most evs now are putting two motors
in the car
i'm gonna be interested seeing more of
more evs come out
with that to see who's if technology is
any different
in terms of like sending power and not
power because generally the way
all-wheel drive
works in terms of traction is this wheel
is slipping
i have the capability of making that
wheel have less power and the opposite
will have more power to make up for it
and thus gain traction and subaru's been
top of the line of that for
years and years and years so i wonder if
they're gonna
lose this step here or lose a step up on
the competition
i'm not totally sure i think i would
theorize that
this is no longer a unique subaru
advantage exactly in evs where
traction is computer controlled
literally every ev
with dual motor all-wheel drive has
better traction than literally
every combustion engine car well they're
still using computers
to differentiate they are but the
electric motor instant torque and
instant delivery of differences in
torque
is always going to be more responsive
than what a computer can do controlling
a gas engine
so the all-wheel drive traction of a
model 3 is world-class
because it's a computer-controlled
electric motor and that's just going to
be the way it is for all of them quick
question about that
is instant torque beneficial in traction
because generally immediate power
creates
too much spin in less traction therefore
potentially
i think it's also more it's micro
adjustments that make it so good so yeah
you do
think of electric torque being like put
the pedal to the floor
immediate maximum torque and that's
really cool but i think the micro
adjustments of like your right two
wheels go through a puddle
like in the in the first like 80th of a
rotation of the tire the car knows it's
in water and is already starting to
adjust traction
so it's that super quick and
computer-controlled stuff it's not a bad
thing that they're all getting it
i'm happy there are no amazing traction
what i'm excited about is when there's
enough cars out there that they start
comparing and seeing which ones are then
now
using this technology to really bring it
to the best traction control
possible yeah i mean like we're going to
see new things which are going to be
really exciting you're going to see
tank turn from a riveting truck you're
going to see weird like
torque vectoring parking tricks probably
um
but i want to touch on one thing you
mentioned which i think is the most
important here
in terms of people who are fans of
subaru
is that a lot of people who buy them
generally buy them for
the outdoors for going on long trips
because they have
all-wheel drive they're cheaper and they
have a lot of like space in them usually
they have pretty good gas mileage for
what they are as well um
so range is going to be huge here if
this comes out with that like
what was that one hyundai that came out
that i'd like 200 miles of range
yeah i think it'll be fall flat and
completely
yeah it would seem sort of a
counter-intuitive
for a subaru designed for adventures to
have
so short of a range that you're worried
you can't pull it off yep
that's my main worry about it here
that's a that's a combination
of range and charging network we'll see
what the charging network
infrastructure plug-in i don't think
they've announced that yet is it going
to be just like electrify america is it
going to be a bunch of different
third-party networks
don't know yet uh let's do tesla
superchargers it's still an option
but uh yeah we don't know yet so that'll
be interesting because they're such a
smaller company
they've got to be one of the smaller
already established car companies now
jumping into the
eevee market as far as i know because
generally like a lot of these companies
are all you know
branded under one where subaru as far as
i know as independent okay
um which yeah i'm surprised they're
jumping in i'm really happy they are
i think range will be huge if they could
come out and say they have like
a range similar to tesla like what would
you this is where you compare
tesla to so what would you want to see
if you were gonna switch from your
impreza what is it yeah what would you
want to see on
paper at least for range if we gave you
let's say electrify america honestly the
only thing i would care about is
just like top top range on it top
battery range
on it 400 miles 400 miles would be
fantastic
380 320 320 is where i'd start getting
worried
290. yeah i probably wouldn't think
about it okay yeah
so here's the thing wow we've talked
about this for a long time but
i do want to say i was very hyped for
this but there are a lot of people on
twitter that were also hyped for it i
think
they have a pretty loyal like uh
audience
is that are they the ones that was uh
like talking to me on twitter for a
while and we were talking about what we
were excited about was like all right
cool there's other people like in the
tech business that are really pumped
about this um
but yeah 400 miles would be incredible
the thing though is like if you want to
say it needs range for adventuring
assume those adventures are outside of
even tesla's charging network
right because if i'm going i
i'm living on like the west side of new
jersey where between
me and the uh the studio right now
there's one tesla supercharger
whereas if you go south or north there's
like four or five superchargers
so if i continue to go west into
pennsylvania which is
if i'm not on a busy highway i'm
probably not gonna hit a supercharger
around there
yeah so like charging network is
important but i think top
top range is most important okay because
i think it'll nail everything else
it'll have space traction yeah i think
the design will be
be solid they're always pretty good at
designing like what you need
and for ruggedness they're not they're
the exact opposite of that eqs that we
saw
they have the bare minimum stuff inside
cool
all right i want to talk about some
youtube features
okay i talk about youtube a pretty good
amount just like kind of around the
studio
probably been a while on the podcast
since we've talked about it as a
platform there's a good amount of stuff
so here's here's what i'll give you two
choices so the new mobile quality
selector or youtube shorts which one
should we do first
i'm going to let you choose this one hmm
all right i can probably get this rant
out of the way real quick
i basically was saying rant on okay uh
so
youtube's new mobile video quality
selector it's been around for a couple
couple weeks now you've probably seen it
uh you used to just go up to the little
three dots in the corner
and hit the quality thing and then just
pick your resolution right simple yeah
people know big number means more
resolution people know
that big number means more data i think
we're all on the same page there
i think youtube tried to simplify it
and in their efforts of simplifying
choosing quality they actually ended up
making it
annoyingly more complicated where now
you're picking a text option
let me just pull it up i tweeted a
screenshot of this so i can just read it
to you real quick
uh you are now choosing not between like
1080 or 720 you're choosing between
auto recommended adjust to give you the
best experience for your conditions
or higher picture quality adjust to use
more data
or data saver lower picture quality or
advanced select a specific resolution
that's the new selector
and it tells you what the quality is for
your current video and if it's automatic
it might cycle up to
720 maybe 1080 if your internet
connection is good enough
if you want to just switch to 4k because
you know it's a 4k video
you have to go to the three dots you
have to go to
video quality you have to go to advanced
then you have to go to
scroll down and then hit 4k not looking
forward to that it's
it's just worse it's just worse um it's
more confusing for sure
it's more clicks it's a little more
confusing and i feel like
youtube was thinking we want to simplify
this and just make people go higher
quality lower quality
they're switching to lower quality
because they want to save data or
they're switching to higher quality
because they want better quality so
that's what we'll put in text
but people already know that and i don't
think
any new users or brand new people to the
internet are confused about
does the big number help my video
quality or data like obviously the big
number is more data can i clarify
something here sure
so this is what happens now when you're
inside of a video and you click the
quality thing yeah right
i could see this working better if it
were like
in your youtube settings it used to be
that's where it was and you that's how
you defaulted things you're like i want
this default to be
i'm on my phone like maybe if it's on
mobile data i want it to take less data
if i'm on wi-fi i want higher quality
stuff like that that would make sense i
remember a really long time ago
i made a tutorial video on
there was a channel toggle a a login
user-centric channel toggle where you
could default to the highest available
resolution on every video you watch
and that was a toggle you could check
and you just accept that that use more
data but on the desktop like i want that
and i i made i'm pretty sure that's
still somewhere on the internet of like
me showing people how to do that
hello everyone youtubers and everyone
who subscribed already welcome to
another hd tutorial and in this video
i'll be showing you how to get your
youtube videos to always play in the
highest quality without you having to
choose it to do so
i'm the type of person to do that i
don't know if everyone's going to do
that but i feel like generally
people know if they're watching a video
and it's blurry they're going to turn it
up to the higher number yeah
so just one less click higher number
easy
um no more mashed potatoes this is also
the this is the thing
though is when youtube gets to this
point where they roll out this feature
and it's everywhere they've thought a
lot about it and they really want to do
it
so my real feedback if youtube's
actually listening
is they're probably not going to want to
get rid of this i would say give us an
option if we would like to just go
straight to
the resolution selector that would just
be easier
for a lot of people i think a lot of
people would do that and maybe some some
kid will make a tutorial on how to do it
and then one day he'll have a great tech
channel where he makes all kinds of
videos and reminisces about it
and then poops on youtube on his podcast
yeah
all right great hold on real quick adam
off camera who's on the board just
brought up a great point we're gonna get
him a mic so he can just like chime in
straight away
but there's a possibility youtube
just wants to discourage people from
switching to 4k right away like
immediately going to the highest quality
and not really thinking about it so
they've added a little bit of friction
they've added a little bit of an extra
hurdle to jump over
so that most people just leave it in
auto and don't think too hard because
even if you go to higher quality
it doesn't necessarily go to the highest
resolution oh wait really
it's still dependent on your connection
it just goes to one of the higher
resolutions so i was doing this before i
switched to higher resolution
and it brought me to 1080 on a 4k video
i tested it on our own video oh wow so i
selected give me the higher quality it
went 1080. i want a 1440p
i mean it's higher quality it's higher
but like i am already toggling this
phone to be a 1440p
screen yeah because i want to see those
videos in 1440 and youtube is making me
jump again
so is it a bandwidth saving thing adam
might be right i just
wish they would just give me the option
i think there definitely is some aspect
of bandwidth saving there
um that makes the fact that it's more
friction i don't know if it necessarily
my argument would be less that it's more
friction and harder to change and more
that it's
like hinting like hint nudge nudge like
the way they explain it in text rather
than numbers makes it
feel like you're getting what is best
for you they're like
they're telling you what's best for you
which therefore comes
back to including less bandwidth and
benefits them
definitely does that make sense it does
yeah yeah and then when you put both of
those together now they're just
selling a lot of 487 videos i'm dying on
this hill youtube i hate it
please change it uh all right that rant
is over
we want to talk about youtube shorts so
we saw a headline earlier this uh
this week about youtube creating this
hundred million dollar creator fund
because they're gonna start paying some
of the top short
creators i not even creators it was some
of the top short videos i believe
they're going to reach out
and pay them yeah i read the uh i'll
just read the excerpt real quick
each month they'll reach out to
thousands of creators whose shorts
receive the most engagement
and views to reward them for their
contributions so if you have a couple
shorts go viral
expect an email going would you like to
get paid
yeah out of the fund the thing is we
don't know how much they're gonna pay
them this 100 million dollar creator
fund
sounds great in a headline but if
they're reaching out to thousands of
people a month
i don't know what what kind of money it
is it's still nice money and it's still
them trying to attract people to shorts
but i just like i feel like
shorts in general are just kind of a
really great way of explaining how like
youtube launches these new features they
fall flat
and then they're trying to find ways to
get people to do them
and i think that all because of that it
boils down to like
why are these not working and why are
people love youtube like
people made their whole lives on youtube
you have i literally have a job because
you have
but like why are these main creators not
doing these other things i think i can
speak to that yeah i
so first of all the the creator funds
that we keep seeing it's like my
favorite new trend of like
yeah there's a tick-tock one this week
for tick-tocks
exactly the same thing yeah and it's
because the platforms
realize they not just want but need
creators on their platforms
making stuff to make them work that
realization
great uh now youtube shorts
so the hesitation by a lot of youtubers
to dive into shorts is really
interesting i think a lot of the
longer term creators like me
have a bit of an aversion to youtube
releasing
new untested unproven features
because they could possibly have adverse
algorithmic effects
they could possibly get killed in six
months
and you will have just poured a bunch of
resources and pivoted your channel
down a path that ends up being a
dead-end road so
the other end of that is if the feature
works
i think there are a lot of younger
creators or more nimble creators who
will just jump right in
and do a bunch of shorts or do a bunch
of was lasting youtube stories i think
that's
might have been dead already yeah but i
don't see anyone post stories
yeah but they'll they'll once they
premieres the thing is they launch a
feature like that
and they have a whole plan behind it
backing it
as if it's going to be the future of the
platform so when
creators see that they'll go oh okay i
see that stories is going to be a really
big deal for youtube
for the for foreseeable future let me
pivot hard and make sure that's a big
part of my content strategy
and then when it's dead in a year you
feel like you
wasted a lot of time resources you might
have hired for it like that's a
that's a big loss like that's a big risk
to take
but if it does explode and let's say
shorts is the
you know this huge future category on
youtube a lot of younger creators who
got in early and
focused really hard on that are going to
be really happy about it
so shorts is clearly a response to tick
tock it's literally almost the same
thing like you go in to hit shorts
on the youtube app and it's this endless
scrolling carousel of
vertical videos that's kind of what
you'd expect the algorithm tries to
learn you
um but youtube knows that it needs
youtube shorts creators instead of just
people uploading to tick-tock and then
copying that file and also putting it on
shorts which is most of them
that's what they're doing that's what
they did on reels like that's
it's literally like watermark to take
time yeah like literally all of reels
has the tick tock like
yeah watermark and the name on it and
people are probably just using reels to
find more people to go follow on tick
tock
and they they literally show up in my
explore page like the ones that
instagram is suggesting to me on my
explore page have tick tock and
like tick-tock logos on them that's
really funny and if anyone was going to
do the
a tick tock competitor it would be
instagram it just makes the more sense
the
the demographic that is on tick tock is
very
very active on instagram and it's just
that social media platform that short
form social media platform that it makes
way more sense on
yeah and it's tick tock still blowing
reels out of the water
yeah yeah so youtube i mean this is a
smart move from youtube no doubt like
they are
the video home on the internet and if
you
run youtube and you see tick tock
another version of videos blowing up
of course you need to make a competitor
for it to offer people an alternative
and possibly they'll come to youtube
later the question is how do you get
those creators to come to youtube
okay well we have a creator fund we're
gonna start making it easy to monetize
tech talk is
also still not easy to monetize and
they're also doing a creator fun thing
which is smart
um but i think generally at the end of
the day the
creators looking to make a job out of it
are
thinking about ease of monetization
first discoverability
right behind that and youtube is trying
to lock both those things up and they'll
they obviously have discoverability but
the tick tock algorithm is something
special
just just surfaces things you want to
see it's really good so
they have that to compete against i do
think that there's the aspect that we
touched on really at the beginning of
that you touched on it really quickly is
just like
you're talking about bringing new
creators in youtube definitely also
already houses
some of the biggest creators in the
world and they definitely want those
creators to
use their new features because if those
creators use their new features that's
still bringing more people in
and i think that's where you talk about
the unknowingness of the algorithm
really starts making those big creators
weary
of jumping into some of these new
features we
still don't use premiere premieres
they've been around for a long time
because from what we've found have i
explained this i don't
know i don't know if we have we may have
just might as well do a refresher
yeah yeah so premieres what happens with
a premiere is if you think of like a
movie or like say a tv show where
premieres on tv
everyone watches it at once youtube sees
that on tv and goes you know what we're
going to be the video home of the
internet will offer something like that
so you can make a whole youtube video
upload it
and then set it to premiere so everyone
watches it
at the same time live they can't fast
forward they're all watching it with you
and there's a live chat and it's really
cool and they obviously thought a lot
about it
and theory is amazing it's in theory a
great idea
what i noticed because i've sort of
stepped back and watched a bunch of
premieres happen and saw what was going
on with them
the impressions seem to
plummet because of the first few minutes
of the video
going live because when you think about
it when a video shows up in your sub box
a bunch of people all click on it at
once and they all watch it
and then they leave when a video is
premiering
a bunch of people all click on the
premiere and for those first
15 minutes however long the video is
they all watch the premiere
then when it's over they leave then it
shows up in the sub box
and i have no idea how they counted
those live views
typically seems pretty low to me so i
haven't we did a premiere with the
was it the blind smartphone camera test
and i kind of observed the same thing or
like the first
hour it was 10 out of 10 like half the
views of normal video and then it
eventually caught up but i just i see
that and i'm like
i'm not going to keep doing this let me
clarify there you say 10 out of 10 if
you don't know what we're talking about
that sounds amazing
we're saying the the best hour or
whatever or
the best impressions for the last 10
videos it was ranked 10 out of 10. so
yeah
the worst they literally had the worst
rating out of our last 10 videos yeah
with like half the views of number nine
so it was pretty bad so yeah i see that
kind of thing and i'm like well once
they figure that out i'll do premieres
again but it's not really ready for
me to keep diving in and pushing videos
through that
same thing happens with like stories
they kind of did for a while and now
it's
i i'm pretty sure it's dead yeah
i think it's still there but no one uses
it but like if we're talking about how
something we like kind of understand
with the algorithm but don't totally
this podcast right now is a great
example because people might wonder why
we made a podcast
video channel and a podcast clips
channel and
if you look at a lot of other podcasts
they do the same joe rogan h3
lou later they all have separate ones
and the reason
the theory behind it is that if you have
long form content
and you have shorter clips the watched
overall watch time on the channel is
going to be
all over the place because if you have
30 minutes of watch time on the long one
and
six minutes of loft watch time on the
short one it gets confused and has a
hard time
yeah like serving those videos yeah so
that's why we separate them and because
of that unknowingness
people are creating these different work
arounds on youtube and i think
bringing that all back to now shorts
imag
imagine being a channel like us that
creates generally
10 to 15 minute videos now putting a
bunch of
not just to mention that they're
vertical which we would never ever ever
put on the channel
but putting a bunch of 60 second clips
on where the watch time is 60 seconds
how is that gonna affect our 15 minute
videos right the answer
probably is just separate shorts channel
i mean we've seen that
yeah it's now you have a dedicated
audience that is there for
shorts and they will watch inconsistent
watch time short videos
and if you do that on your separate
shorts channel great i would consider
that a fail for
youtube's marketing in the sense that
they're hoping big creators bring this
to their main audience
where the minute you switch it to
another audience you're going to lose a
giant portion
of your already subscribers because if
they missed the announcement to like
check out the shorts channel they're
never going to see it yeah so now like
as youtube they've lost already if
that's what's happening and so it seems
like their fail-safe to that
is to try to dump as many people into
shorts as possible oh i mean yeah
but that's a thing we we were talking
about shorts yesterday with tim
yeah i tried to look at shorts on my
desktop and i literally couldn't find it
oh you won't find that on the desktop
but you will find it on your phone which
is why they're competing with tick tock
i mean yes you can watch tick tock on
your desktop on desktop
it's there and you can find it but it's
the same way tick tock
tick tock on desktop that's a tongue
twister exists but you don't
really care about it if they're
competing with tiktok which is really
what shorts is and really what reels is
you can watch it on the desktop
but it's all about that endless scroll
on the smartphone and they've built that
in and then they put the button right at
the bottom of the app
where it used to be the explore page or
i think it's next to it oh okay
so now their goal is to just dump as
many people organically into shorts as
possible
same way you know instagram did where
they replaced the add post button put it
up at the corner
and put shop there same behavior let's
just dump people in
and put it in the place where they're
familiar and they're going to see it
over and over and they're eventually
going to click it
so instagram a little weird moving
around button placement like that but
that's basically what youtube did
get in there get in shorts find stuff
you're into and then you'll be a
shorts viewer from here on out i'm sure
youtube can figure out a way to put that
on desktop they're one of the social
media apps
that probably gets the closest to
mobile equal mobile and desktop usage
like instagram obviously is so far
mobile tiktok
is even further mobile i would argue
facebook now is mostly mobile
despite it originating on desktop but
like if we're talking about youtube i
think they have
probably more mobile users but i bet
that's much closer
i would push back just a little because
i think it is oddly
very specific to what type of content it
is
and i think because literally shorts is
required to be vertical
like which is terrible yeah so like but
that's because they want it to fit
as the same tick tock thing like you can
you can
do a horizontal tick tock but it just
looks ridiculous in the app they want it
to be
the tick tock experience and so they've
built everything around it being
just like tick tock but on youtube and
then they're trying to bring creators in
with the creator fund with like i think
that's where
i was trying to go with like the fact
that there is a
higher average people that use youtube
on desktop because like
it is it was originally built on desktop
it became mobile and even when you're
using mobile you're almost almost
turning to landscape whereas
tick tock works well because it's only
supposed to be on a phone
reels worked okay because instagram is
still a vertical scrolling
mobile app youtube is not quite
that it was developed into that it's
becoming good at it
but it still always has its heart and
soul in the desktop version of it
yeah and that's why this feature just
feels a little off
i think if they if they wanted to feel
less soft they would have made it a
separate app like a youtube shorts app
so that's right
you can go vertically just like i did it
worked bad because nobody's opening that
app
so they have to build it yeah i just
don't know how yeah
they've it's going to have to feel a
little off because it's different from
the rest of youtube
but that's why i take talk today i
should have just made a clubhouse
competitor
yeah so much more so i guarantee that's
happening i guarantee it
do you think though because their whole
shtick is video
and clubhouse's whole shtick is not
video youtube did a
a clubhouse competitor it would probably
have like the little waveform video
playing while you talked or something
it would look like one of those you know
how twitter did uh audio tweets
yeah where you can talk and it'll just
make like an animation for you talking
they'll probably do that i think there's
a clubhouse competitor where they you
upload your bitmoji
and that talks as it is that real
i believe so i forget what it's called i
could fit i could
figure it out i think it's called stereo
actually
please i think it's i think it's
actually kind of an interesting idea
just adds like one more step of
personalization where you still get to
have that like
i'm talking to a group of people but i
don't have to like get ready or develop
a set
or anything like that and it adds one
more step
of personal experience i don't think
it's a bad idea
i just don't think it's going to compete
with clubhouse just be that's not the
one feature that's going to make
everyone move
does it require my core question is does
it require you to have your phone facing
your face
so that it uses the like animation face
tracking stuff wait before i
answer that well i don't know the answer
to that question if i'm being honest but
do you want it to have that no okay no i
would assume
just because i believe it's it's
available on android that it does not do
that that it's probably just i hear a
waveform i make the mouth move okay
that's my guess interesting i don't know
i've never used it i've only heard about
it
yeah all right that's probably enough
talking about youtube let's talk about
nothing
easy that's i'm great at that let's talk
about absolutely nothing
um they're coming out with some earbuds
see what i did there
where's the cricket noise on the
soundboard
oh that might have been the worst uh
joke i've ever told no the
so anyway for those unfamiliar uh carl
pays new company
he left one plus he started this new
company this tech company called nothing
and every time they make a headline it's
some sort of pun about how
nothing has announced something or
somebody's announced nothing
uh the company name is nothing and i
guess what do we know now uh they're
launching wireless earbuds yeah you can
only announce nothing for so long before
you have to announce something which
at that point feels like it's already
destroyed the complete
reason of having the company but yeah i
digress it's kind of funny that
it's the same uh the same like extra
beat i have to give when explaining a
brand name
when someone asks what my phone was and
i have to be like this is the oneplus 9
and i go the what and i go it's the so
the company name is one plus and then
it's the nine so it's a one plus nine
like oh
okay i get it so now you're gonna have
to go so what is this the nothing
one so i'll have to go oh these are the
nothing one
the what oh um so the company name is
nothing and then these are the ones so
this is another one that's a
great realization and now i just assume
carl pay is going to continue to
create companies quit and then name more
confusing companies this is
the about seven the what oh
so the the company name is about and
then these are the seven so this is the
about seven
oh okay you better copyright that right
i'll take ten percent
uh we don't really know anything else
about these right is that a product
image
there is a product in they have like a
teaser i feel like i saw
what i thought was an image somewhere
but i can't tell if they just created
more out of the teaser
um so what we do know is they're
partnering with teenage engineering
which someone i knew nothing about until
adam explained it to us and
um they make some really really good
looking design stuff
yeah so i've these the image we have of
these are kind of like a
the bottom part of the earpiece the
earbud that is like
clear they're just teasing it like every
angle it looks really nice but at the
same time
like what i'm most interested about is
carl is somebody who's really good at
hyping up products he was obviously
amazing at one plus they built their
whole ecosystem kind of based on like
flagship killer low price right so when
i originally see carl pay
starting a new company i kind of think
it's going to go in that low price route
the problem is is teenage engineering is
not that by any means they are
very expensive because they make super
high quality stuff
so is this going to be super
hype high priced beautifully designed
earbuds or this is going to be the
oneplus of earbuds that is
cheaper with really great specs and
competing against
airpods or galaxy buds plus i
would imagine i mean that the vibe i got
was
closer to one plus just because of like
the teasing that i've got where it's
like
look at all that we're going to deliver
for you
but yeah that is a really good point
like the collaboration
because you still you see stuff like
they collab with hasselblad and now that
the phone's more expensive but does a
collaboration with teenage engineering
mean that this product will be more
expensive
i guess i don't even know if it just has
to do with that
they're collabing with teenage
engineering but if they're helping
design it they use very high quality
products and i think just
literally based on what the build
quality is going to be
sounds like it will be more expensive so
i'm going to go on the other side of the
coin of that and i'm going to guess
these are expensive
do you want to try and guess a price
based on yeah let's get almost nothing
let's guess the price so
yeah did it again let's go uh wow so
we know silhouette we know company name
we know the name they're wireless
earbuds i say these are
149. that's your cheap
[Music]
following in the footsteps of oneplus
well not quite
no they're not going to be like these
cheap buds that you just
bluetooth connect to anything i think
they're going to go like look how
beautiful these are they're transparent
they sound amazing and they're only 149
but they sound like 4.99 i think that's
going to be the angle
but are there 4.99 earbuds out there oh
yeah
really there are 6.99 there are thousand
dollar earbuds there's in-ear monitors
well yeah i was gonna say there's in-ear
monitors and stuff like that yeah
yeah uh there's a um
audience audience audience these are the
things i had those
they sent us those ones that like the
they weren't truly wireless they just
had wires but
remember they were like uh they felt
like they like crawled into your brain
yeah they sounded really good though
they were ridiculous they did
and they were like open back also that
was they were really cool but they
hurt and they're really bad after 900 or
something
okay to me if i were saying these are
like
trying to compare to things i would say
it's comparing to buds plus or pixel
buds or
sony or airpods even so i would think
149 would be like right
even so cheaper to me would be 129.
okay 149 i think is a good guess i'm
just saying i don't think it follows the
the uh like one plus playbook so let's
competitors you named uh
pixel buds 115. those are actually i
think those are 129.
airpods example pro 250 yeah an airpods
regular 159 159
so sony there's a range one
are they 199. no they're i think they're
299.
are they really xm okay maybe 149s
is kind of one plus e let me see that
let me look it up just for clarification
the earbuds are
i think they're 1.99 this is the problem
is it's 180.
there's so many earbuds it can yeah it's
really easy to get lost sony's wf-1000
xm3s the wireless noise canceling
earbuds with a little bit of anc
178 at best buy what's worse having to
explain to somebody that oneplus is the
name of a phone or
that nothing's or just having to say a
sony headphone name
out loud it's if i'm trying if i'm
trying to direct somebody directly to
buying it
i hate the sony name it's like okay look
for the sony ones and then they've got
this long name but they're black
and it says xm3 at the end and they're
like wireless noise canceling did you
find him yet
is that enough explanation i could see
like telling your dad to like
look this up on amazon and then he's
just like there's a bunch of ram on my
screen or
like some random like motherboard
because he just got all the numbers and
letters wrong i think i downloaded
something
uh yeah i know i think one i'm going to
stick with 159 is my game i'm going to
go 199.
i think they're going to be a little on
the hyper side and
more build quality i wouldn't even be
surprised at 250.
okay uh but there's also pixel bud
rumors which are
also very light very light uh we have a
name
and a color is that it pretty much
pretty much all we know is like it's
about
the right time for them to announce and
there was this like google nest
email that went out that accidentally
showed i believe a green colorway
of one of them and we also i think saw a
white colorway of one i know there are
were ones that were white already
but they were white and black i believe
there's a rumor a leak of a full white
one
so the the price is in the
rumor uh they're so they're the a series
or the pixel buds a series
is the price in the rumor are they just
guessing it based off of previous prices
they're guessing it based on previous
prices but
you know we could probably guess again
so like uh pixel buds two that are out
right now
279. wait what sorry that's australian
one
i was gonna say they're not that's my
bad australia do not buy them for 270.
yeah 179 for the pixel buds that are out
right now so
does an a series cut that in half like
when we see the pixel 4a that's a pretty
cheap yeah right if it's a does that
mean it's gonna be cheaper
it's weird that they would name it
different and not just three or did they
just
i mean they don't have the best track
record pixel buds one
were hilariously bad though they were
those ones that were supposed to like
translate
uh different languages for you clearly
it was
just the most typical like google
random like feature they throw out like
remember the
chain link fence like eliminator for
photos it's like
hey we're gonna do this and then just
like let's never talk about that again
yeah it kind of got swept under the road
um
two i've heard people have had quite a
few issues with i think adam
is one of them he said they disconnect
pretty regularly
yeah i liked mine i only used them for
like a week which obviously i won't have
nearly as much experience with glitches
but i had
like one phone connected and it was fine
but they're 179 and they're
pretty premium i'm gonna guess pixel
buds a if they come out
are going to be 59.99
i'll go i'm stuck between
99 and 129 even though pixel buds are
129
179 currently cheaper
it is cheaper i have less of a margin
when you're like
cutting price at that price already i'll
go 99
okay 89. we'll have to have somebody
like write these down and fact check us
and see if we get these right in the
future when they come out
uh last one is another rumor a new sony
earbuds rumor
so uh we just mentioned this there's a
little more meat to it
yeah so we mentioned the wf-1000xm3s
i really like them but they are like big
annoying earbuds like you have to sit
down and listen to them because
otherwise they'll fall out your ear
because they're so heavy which is like
what's the point if i'm sitting down and
listening i'd rather just have
over over here they're more comfortable
they probably sound better they have
bigger drivers but like
so some people just like in-ear
monitoring but they're wireless too so
it's different they look like um
like a like a bluetooth like phone
accessory like the headset's back yeah
and somebody would talk like this on
their bluetooth and that they have a mic
you can do that stuff you look like
you're like some wall street like
traders yeah something like that
the rumor is these mark fours will be a
different shape
actually uh if you're in the video
podcast or at least the clips you can
see this new different shape rumored
which is a little more of like a
circular a little closer to a galaxy bud
yeah
way more like galaxy buds from just the
leak i mean and this isn't confirmed
this is just a leak but uh
i'd say it almost looks like half the
size right which i'm
i'm curious if they will have both the
same sound quality
and either the same or better anc
um just as far as like strength of noise
cancellation i didn't find
most of the earbuds that i've used to
have very strong noise cancellation i'd
say honestly airpods pro have the
strongest
noise cancellation at anc active noise
cancellation
of any that i've used it's got a seal
it's got the mic it's really using that
that computational power uh
i wonder if that's gonna be a big focus
of these or if it's just hey we made the
same great sound but smaller which is
also fine but i feel like it's fine
you're gonna get more buyers you wanna
do a little more than just that i'm sure
they'll probably say it's like
10 but they'll throw some percentage out
there that's
not actually noticeable and that like
maybe some people will be like oh yeah
this one
does it does sound 10 better and then
just placebo but the fact that it's
smaller to me which is like
i kind of want to go on a little rain
here at the end of these rumors because
like go for it
that's the that is an example of the
reason i
dislike the majority of
truly wireless earbuds that aren't air
pods
um is the too big they're too
big and they're big in a strange way
essentially if you're
essentially if your earbud is in your
ear i want the least amount
of it hanging out horizontally if that
makes sense
because when the only thing that is
keeping it in your ears the small
silicone tip
the further out it goes the further the
center of gravity pushes out your ear
and with every step you make whether
you're walking or running
you can just feel it slowly slowly
weighted on the outside pushing down and
thus
pulling it out of your ear further and
further and when you have
a product that is that small and not
connected to anything
the last thing you want to happen is it
for to fall out of your ear
yeah so you can make the best silicone
tips in the world if it is too heavy on
the outside
it is going to fall out a perfect
example of that surface buds are
ridiculous and have like a ton coming
out the side of your ear
there are some old bose ones i despised
because they
sat so far out of your ears and the xm3s
as well are like that
i would say the the pushback for the
xm3s would be
you know how you see the ads of like
what you expect people to do with the
product
i think they expect people listening to
xm3s to kind of just be sitting down
and not really doing anything which is a
different type of earbud experience than
walking around the city walking
it's a different earbud it's still an
earbud and it's still focused on quality
and being wireless and connecting to
your phone but it's a little different
that would be the xm3 pushback
i agree with the others though like
especially i guess if you're trying to
do you know pixel buds and galaxy buzz
they're getting closer into your ear
i think galaxy buds plus are some of the
best
they do come out a little bit but
because the main
thickness is at the back part that's
touching on the inside of your ear the
center of gravity is closer to the
your ear canal therefore it doesn't feel
like it's going to pop out there's no
wiggle
as you're moving i use the jaybird
vistas and the reason i've been using
them for so long is because
and we test a lot in here we get
jabra anchor like everything you could
ever think of makes it into the studio
and
the first thing i do is try them on and
like walk 10 steps back and forth
and i can instantly tell if i think
they're going to fall out the job
or the jaybird vistas that i have are
amazing they just like
they have a little wingtip but not
anything that's gigantic and it's just
enough to almost fit flush with my ear
maybe that's a me thing i think but i
think they fit perfectly yeah
my theory is there's there's a different
like target demographic i'm thinking of
like
surface buds were huge but they're
you're just sitting in an office i'll
give that credit that's supposed to be
the
i mean i'll give it credit for having a
stupid capability of being able to swipe
through your powerpoint
it needs to be bigger to do that sure
why you would ever want to do that again
i don't know um but there still are
there's still plenty of ones where
i'm i mean i'm sure you've tried it too
you put them in and the minute you start
walking you can
feel it slowly just like pulling out
because they're bouncing
i immediately try it with the ones that
i know i'm supposed to walk around in
like the vistas are an outdoorsy type
like go for a hike in them
like the galaxy buds walk around every
day airpods pro walk around every day
pixel buds wear them all the time
all of them have done a pretty good job
with the center of gravity so i fully
agree with that like you got to get that
yeah and closer today
and airpods doing the silicone tip was
huge because the original ones didn't
fit in everyone's ears but the thing is
is their weight
in that little you know if you want to
imagine like the top of a toothbrush in
the handle part of the toothbrush that's
where all the weight is and that very
well fits the stem the stem
i'll call it a toothbrush okay um it
fits like perfectly in that
groove in the side of your ear and
therefore puts all the weight
there and isn't pulling it out of your
ear the minute it starts pulling it out
okay that's a long rant i just like it's
the main thing that i
when i test those buds that make me very
upset
i'll leave you with one more thing okay
uh one of the best features of really
nice headphones
is a large spatial sound
and the closer the driver is to your ear
the harder it is to achieve that sound
so in really nice over-ear headphones
the driver's in
is set back from your ear and you get a
better i think it's called sound stage
and so in really nice listening earbuds
their challenge of getting that driver
away from your ear directly translates
to the center of gravity
making it feel like it's going to fall
out of your ear i'm sure people
listening to this who make products are
like
there's other reasons why we we do the
things we do we change the designs but
just another thing to think about i i
just feel like uh
that shouldn't be the number one part i
mean like good sound quality is always
great
but good sound quality sucks when it's
an earbud laying in a sewer gutter
because you were walking down the street
and it fell out of your
different strokes different strikes the
other strokes wrong well anyway i think
that's where we'll end it we've
talked our faces off for a bunch of
different reasons and topics and ranted
but
again if you're watching the video
version let us know like
what you want to see done better what
types of stuff you liked and didn't like
we've changed the main angle a little
bit
got this eye level a little more
consistent drop the banner behind us
if you're on the audio just come check
it out really quick to see like
now you can imagine unless you don't
want to see what my face looks like and
want to keep it as a mystery yeah the
mystery
i'll accept that too as long as i look
really cool in your mind fabio
yeah other than that thanks for
listening we'll be back next week
