all right welcome back to another
episode of the waveform podcast we're
your hosts i'm marquez and i'm andrew
and today we've got there's not really a
whole lot of products
coming out it's july yeah it's the
middle of the year it's not too crazy
but
there is still a lot happening in the
tech world generally as there is so
we're going to talk about a bunch of
these different things some of them
are more real newsy than others but
you'll see what we mean by that uh plus
we got a couple
hot takes at the end you have to stay
for hot takes apparently we're making a
segment out of this
i like that i really like the idea of a
hot take segment we'll see how it goes
yeah we'll see how it goes
before we do another segment we'll we'll
definitely fill it out but i wanted to
start off with um
the most important one my favorite major
important headline of this entire week
for sure which is that apple's weather
app
was discovered to not be showing 69
degrees fahrenheit
to anyone anywhere now i saw this i saw
this on twitter first i think the verge
got the first like they made an art
about it they wrote an article
and that was essentially the entire
point of the article i was like guys
you can look in your weather app right
now if you're on ios 14 or earlier
you can look up a city right now that's
69 degrees find it in accuweather find
it in
dark sky whatever and then open the
apple weather app
and it'll say 68 or 70. it refuses to
show you 69
in the current temperature in the
forecast and the highs and the lows
it just won't do it i've seen it in my
weather widget
and as soon as i saw this headline well
naturally i started looking up cities
that i figured were about 69 degrees
fahrenheit we went through
i think it took us like 90 seconds to
find a couple like one ends in maine
i think adam found the first one in what
it was in some other country but then
we figured boston boston boston was
another one and we found
it was 69 degrees in our accuweather app
and for some weird reason it wasn't
a data sourcing error it really just
refused from the same data source to
show
69 degrees so okay immediately the
reactions
are like what okay apple like why
it's not that serious like really
spending extra energy coding to not
show 69 what are you that anti-meme like
is that
seriously where we're at right now feels
almost like the like i guess it's not
exactly the streisand effect but it's
like if you're trying to not show
something chances are everybody is going
to
show that more often yeah the second
this article came out i made a video
like pulling up a city showing that it
was 69 degrees
in this city and that it was 68 i think
it was it was showing
68 or 70 on my phone 68
and yeah you know immediately everyone
starts checking and fact checking their
own phones and seeing what's going on
lots of people running ios 15 beta we're
like you're wrong marquez it shows 69
right here
it does show in ios 15 beta but you're
running a beta os so that's not what i'm
talking about
but this immediately became super
fascinating and
sort of spread around like a wildfire
but the mystery has been solved
the mystery has in fact been solved and
it turns out it's not
just apple being some stuffy megacorp
that doesn't want to show
time yeah it's not it's not actually
just that the first
thing that ticked me off on maybe it
being a little different
is someone tweeted if you notice it also
doesn't ever show
65 or 67 degrees in the weather app
either
again it might show it in the widget
which is kind of interesting but then
you open the app and you look at the
the future forecasts and sure enough in
boston it was like 68 68 68
66 64. and i started looking around and
i also didn't find any other 65s or 67s
which is weird if you're on an iphone
right now on ios 14 or earlier you can
look in the weather app
and you will not find 69 degrees
fahrenheit 67 degrees or 65 degrees so
then it was like okay
what's what's actually going on why um
turns out the reason is most likely
explained
by where they source their data and how
they source their data yeah so a lot of
people are asking well where are you
uh finding that it's 69 versus 68 maybe
it's a discrepancy in the sourcing
it's a weather channel is where now they
bought dark sky which does have their
own data but
at the corner of ios 14's weather app it
still says the weather channel
so if you go to weather.com that's where
they're getting their data from
but it looks like they're sourcing it in
celsius
integers basically now most of the world
uses celsius so that makes a lot of
sense but
here in the u.s we are stubbornly still
using freedom height
f for freedom for fahrenheit and no yeah
so we're
converting these source data celsius
integers not decimals
into fahrenheit and so sure enough
19 degrees celsius is 66.2 degrees
fahrenheit
which rounds to 66 then when you go to
20 degrees celsius that's 68
yeah so you just skip 67 and 21 degrees
celsius
is 69.8 which rounds to 70. so you'll
never show 69.
so this seems to be the most likely
explanation
for why you know it's not showing up and
also probably why you are
seeing it in ios 15 beta is because
they've either
fixed that or adjusted to source
somewhere else dark sky or they're using
integers or with you know decimals now
not just integers
whatever it is it seems to be fixed in
ios 15
but i still thought this was hilarious
because for a couple of minutes there
the internet was like wait it's like
having a ton of fun
what is going on here if somebody found
that it was it was nine it was negative
69 degrees in antarctica and it was
showing that
um which is funny because i looked it up
negative 56 degrees celsius
is negative 68.8 fahrenheit which rounds
to negative 69. so it will show negative
69.
but not positive 69. i like my first
thing i want to know is
because the verge is you said the verge
got the scoop i'm wondering like
was this a scoop something like this
like yeah who thought i
am dying to know who at the verge was
just like
i i'm hoping has this like uh notebook
of just like days that it has not shown
69
to like eventually get to the point
where he's like i'm writing an article
and it wound up being like the most
popular article on the internet
yeah it probably just happened like
somebody tweeted or just
emailed them like hey if you look around
the app you won't see 69 like probably
happened the same way with us where we
don't wait really and then we just
started searching everywhere for
finding 69. i found 69 humidity i did
not find 69 degrees so
yeah once you once you get that far you
kind of write it up and just see what
happens it's one of those things that's
so small where like you would never
really think about it the difference
between
68 69 and 70 degrees like if you stepped
outside you wouldn't be like
this weather app's wrong yeah it's
definitely not
yeah this but um well that get that that
is part of my hot take should i just get
right into my hot take no i think we
should save it for the really we should
save it all right we have to save it for
the
i'll save it um retention retention
one last thing on that though carrot app
which if you don't know what carrot
weather app is it's
hilarious it's just the weather with
usually something really funny like a
sassy weather app
yeah sassy weather app's the best way
but anyways immediately after all this
news broke uh someone posted a
screenshot of just in their carrot app
it just says
feels like 17 degrees i promise to
always tell you when it's 69 degrees out
i i downloaded it as soon as i saw that
oh did you that was
you get it that was what earned my
download i downloaded carrot and yes
immediately it was telling me
is it that's it it's 75 degrees but
we'll tell you when it's 69.
so thank you carrot for uh for the nod
there we appreciate it or maybe the
verge appreciates it whoever you're
nodding to
i'm sure they love it um that's kind of
it that's my
that's my important news of the i just
had to kick that off i'm glad we got it
out of the way
now everyone can take a deep breath and
wait like relax for nice easy
new stuff after yeah we're all about
nothing else
investigative journalism right off the
top uh
apple does have a new product out which
is always you know something we like to
take note of this one
is the magsafe battery pack i want to
give a shout out to brandon
who tweeted years ago that they should
do this he's not the only one who
tweeted this
but i want to give him a little props
for that um it's literally just
a battery pack that slaps onto the back
of the phone with the magnets from
magsafe and wirelessly charges your
iphone
vin called it a giant denty nice kind of
looks like it looks just like it's
an apple logo on it yeah um i like
i think we all had kind of mixed
reactions around the studio it
is one of those things where at first to
me i was like
huh that seems like a pretty good idea
i'd love to just like
have it in my pocket or my backpack or
whatever and if my phone's low
instead of having to carry a wire around
wait till i get my car wait till i get
my desk
have a big battery bank just slap it on
the back and it charges
but then you see it's 99
it's only i think it's under 1500
million backwards
so that wouldn't even charge a full
battery right not only is it smaller
than the actual physical size of the
battery
but wireless charging does lose a lot of
efficiency to heat
so you're looking at maybe 70 to 80
efficiency
of getting that milliamp hour account
into your phone so you're
you're not you're not getting close to a
full charge know that
um i i can already see where this is
going which is like yeah
the crowd that's like just get a wired
power bank that can charge it
eight thousand times and put it in your
backpack i wanted to be the
because i knew that like it's obvious
that's gonna be yeah the the
suggestion there and like the argument
and i wanted to argue against it as like
this is nice because it's small and it
can it's like super easy
it's typical apple it's not complicated
it's just like
the most perfect way of solving it
except for now seeing that it
won't even charge a full battery i just
don't see why you wouldn't buy
the anker power core 26 000 milliamp
hours
for 70 bucks it's clearly bigger clearly
needs cables but i can charge anything
why i can charge my switch i can charge
my laptop i can charge my phone i can
charge my
cell class here like i can charge
everything with it i just don't get why
i wouldn't i'd rather just deal with the
cable because
apple makes products for a universe
where other companies don't exist
so they still have other products that
exist that this thing could charge it
doesn't even charge the
product fully that it's made for and you
can charge your
phone with your macbook pro if you
really want that much battery which i've
done by the way if you can just plug it
directly in
with that cable um i think this is just
like an easy convenient
thing this isn't this is like an incase
of emergency like convenience thing oh
what's that you have 20
battery and you still have more stuff to
do today pop it on the back of the phone
don't even think about it you'll have
the rest of the day for enough battery
like you charge it up with lightning you
just have it for when you need it it's
in your bag it's in your purse whatever
it's a
it has to be charged by lightning you
gotta charge you know that but is it
lightning or is it usbc oh
it's light i believe it's like adam
saying it's like it's lightning because
it's
it's in the iphone's world where you
would only buy this if you have an
iphone
so you have a lightning charger yeah but
if it's apple they're assuming you have
a macbook too right which is usb-c
well if you have any laptop it's a
macbook but maybe you don't have a
laptop
so yeah it's a lightning charge thing uh
yeah
super simple but obviously it's the
classic apple like wow it's a little
overpriced it's 100 bucks for half a
charge
but it is the one there are other
third-party ones by the way that do the
exact
exact same clip on the back magsafe
wireless charging
not not even clipped they just
magnetized yeah i guess that's what i'm
doing i think anchor makes one of the
better ones
it's not as pretty but i don't think
this apple one's that
pretty i think apples would be prettier
if they match colors to the different
iphones like
it feels like something they should do
let me show you the anchor one
because i think apples is way better
looking than the anchor one this is the
the one that anchor made
right i'd take the apple one every time
it's bigger it doesn't taper either
around the the edges the way out here's
the thing do you expect so when i first
see these i'm like
are people gonna like continue to use
their phone with this on the back
yeah yeah yeah yeah like that i guess it
makes the most sense yeah like it's like
i'm guessing they're just probably not
doing the battery case anymore right
yeah
i do have to assume that it probably has
like one or two
features with it just in the sense of
like magsafe connecting because it's
first party
um and like i would always prefer to do
first party over anything but it's still
just
to me i don't know feels rough
yeah it's just it's just a apple world
thing like lots of people are going to
be in the apple store
and realize that they want a battery
case and this is the one that they sell
for the iphone 12 it slaps on the back
it's kind of neat it doesn't have to be
amazing some people just have that money
to just go okay
i just want a battery that's just going
to work with the iphone i also wonder
how many mag safe accessories you can
have that then
like which are taking over the other
ones so like if i have an apple wallet i
have to take that off every time now
to use this charging thing right yes you
do
uh if you have a magsafe case
you can put this on the back of the
magsafe case and it will charge your
phone through the case
like the magsafe charger puck would not
the most efficient thing in the world
but it works
i would really like to see just last
thing to say on that is how
from a dead battery how much it actually
charges what would your guess be
um so the iphone 12 like pro
let's just go regular 12. iphone 12 what
is the battery size iphone 12's got a
battery
that is it's like 36 right no it's
smaller
it's much smaller uh iphone 12 2
815 milliamp hours okay wow so
the thing about that is you're you're
coming in at 14.60 for this so that's
half
if you get all of it out of the battery
uh yeah i'm gonna go 40
40 yeah i mean in most days that gets
you through the day so it doesn't really
it's fine i'm not i'm not in the target
demographic
yeah no i'm not either that one um all
right let's let's go to something a
little different i guess
uh i have no good
no good segue for this one but it was a
fun article i thought i found
okay and it's about planes which is fun
because there's a plane flying over and
you might not here
there's the segway finally finally
newark airport
working for us yeah um
all right so united to buy a hundred
electric planes for short-haul trips
wow this is electric planes that's
exactly what i said when i saw this
not only are there i guess electric i
mean clearly we have to assume there are
people working on electric planes like
that's just
gotta be one but the fact that we're
close enough to being like united's
pledging
to buy a hundred of them uh it's from a
startup company in sweden called
heart aerospace um
i think the main thing here is don't
think immediately like giant commercial
i'm gonna say 747 i think that's a
larger plane but i'm sure
yeah it is okay this uh this article
says 19 passenger plane
250 mile range very small so essentially
the
what it is actually really good for is
if you think of like a large
airport hub chicago o'hare is a perfect
example because in the midwest
it connects flights from the east coast
the west coast and kind of sends you
everywhere from there but at the same
time it has a ton of midwest states
around it that
you would generally fly into take a very
small plane to hop
to michigan or to hop to north dakota or
something like that
so it would take over there where a lot
of those planes are getting
can't or those flights are getting
canceled because it's not
efficient or it's not uh there's not
enough people getting on the plane to
make it worth flying yeah to make it
worth flying with fuel costs and
everything like that so like they're not
doing as many of those flights anymore
so it just would start taking over
smaller trips like that
um and that's i think pretty awesome and
it says these could be
like in service as soon as 2026 which is
not that far away five years away so
that's
that's pretty amazing it's cheaper it's
clearly like the biggest thing here is
just planes have
crazy emissions and we're clearly in in
a world where we need to
reduce emissions and and i appreciate
them taking a step
and hopefully it leads to bigger steps
of eliminating those
yeah yeah yeah this is i mean i so i
don't know
pretty much anything about electric
planes i've i've heard that this is like
a thing
that would be really cool to work on but
every time it's come up i think i talked
to nodegrass tyson about this
the energy density of batteries isn't
quite good enough yet
yeah uh to to lift all that weight of
the battery off and then fly with the
power
generated from the battery but as
battery tech improves maybe that's a
projection that
will make this possible by 2026.
um but the other thing is yeah like
when you think about sustainable energy
we're on you know the cars are actually
starting to see the light we're starting
to see
maybe in 10 20 years there will be way
more electric cars on the road
and eventually we see a world where
we've wiped out
the amount of emissions coming from cars
there still leaves
boats trains planes are
an absolutely massive one as you pointed
out and uh
eventually yeah we got to get to those
too so the fact that we start with the
small ones like
the nissan leaf of planes or whatever
that's fine that's a good start but
obviously we want to get to the the
massive planes too yeah i wonder how
well this would do also in just like the
private plane sector i mean i know
that's not
you know it's not hitting emissions like
a 747 but there still are a lot of
private planes flying all over the place
and it's it's almost
if you're doing it by passenger it
probably could be pretty similar to like
emissions
per person no no what i mean so like if
these are smaller planes maybe that
i'm also this is a total assumption here
so
if someone wants to correct me please
yeah put
private planes or a very small number of
passengers very high number
number of emissions per passenger but
they are small planes with smaller gas
tanks they don't really do
cross-country flights the same way 747
no which is what yeah why
something like this is a good place to
start yeah cool i just thought that was
really neat yeah i look for i hope in my
lifetime that i'm able to fly on an
electric plane that would be really
awesome
i think it would still feel exactly the
same as a passenger
as a regular plane because it's just
gonna it's still jets
i imagine it's still making lots of
noise because it's instead of burning
fuel
it's still running the turbines exactly
yeah so it's still going to feel like a
regular jet but i just hope
that for principle i can in my lifetime
ride an electric plane that would be
cool it would be cool it would be cool
to just also ride in a brand new plane
every time i'm in a plane and i feel
like it's nice i like hear someone talk
about i'm like it's like this is a 30
year old plane
it's just oh it's pretty new tells me
how long those are like uh
stay in commission last thing
nothing and stockx i saw this this is a
weird one that came out like
20 minutes before we sat down to record
this and we just
wanted to talk about it quickly man okay
so
you've probably heard by now about
nothing they're making
a bunch of products starting with
headphones the year one
and we know they're going to be these
transparent earbuds they
started to slowly tease information
about them one by one
this is like their their whole strategy
is kind of the same as what oneplus is
doing because it's
the same ceos oneplus used to have carl
from oneplus
um and they've gone all the way to the
very
highest end of hype i've been using the
word hype to talk about this but i think
stockx connection sort of solidifies it
because
what is a more hype connected company
than stockx stockx
is a uh a reseller listing
site for a lot of apparel and footwear
for hype stuff hype shoes hype apparel
so if you find a high pair of shoes and
you want to buy
you know somebody bought uh one of the
limited edition drops and has one in
your size you want to buy it secondhand
from them
does this whole verification process and
you can buy one or auction
a pair of shoes and that's kind of what
they're known for they started branching
off though
more recently into like electronics i
think they got the ps5 on there for a
while which is interesting one of the
most hype
gadgets like partnered with sony or i
don't know if it was a partner with sony
but it was definitely available for a
while
on stockx with the whole verification
thing and everything so
this nothing partnership
is a it's an auction where they'll be
auctioning
the first 100 pairs which will come with
like a little engraving and a little
special
you know box or whatever um to whoever
submits the 100 highest bids yeah it
will be available for general
availability later
but uh and i think we know the price
already 100 bucks
so the 100 people who just want to spend
however much they want to be
one of the first hundred can get one
whether they
spend 101 or two hundred dollars or
whatever they want
they just have to be one of the top
hundred bits yeah the the engraving
you're talking about is the
edition of it so it's like a limited
edition one to 100
you get this the serial number
essentially i'm assuming the rest of
them after that aren't going to have the
engraved serial number on it
so these are like yeah just the first
100 you're basically paying to
say that you have one of the first 100
of a
company that doesn't really exist yet so
here's this made a product yeah exactly
so here's the thing on one hand i get it
it's the perfect
engine for like the beginning of hype if
you're a brand new electronics company
building hype
what better way to get people really
into it and to make a bunch
of money than to give people the feeling
of exclusive early access
and anyone can you if you bid high
enough you can have one of the first
hundred
of these cool gadgets this company is
making that's like a feeling people
really like
exclusive early access whatever it is
but on the other hand having one of the
first hundred products that a new
electronics company makes
i think is really rarely actually
valuable like if you had one of the
first
100 iphones which is not by the way one
of apple's first ever products if you
had an apple one
okay yeah that's very valuable but
that's apple
like imagine if you had one of the first
hundred
one plus once because that's you know
that's a company that's done pretty well
they've had a couple years of success
really had to come up same
ceo that's about as good as a company
can go
in in the short term how much is a one
plus one worth
if you have one of the first hundred
today not i don't
i mean i'm sure it's worth something
whether it was worth
holding on to it for that long or or
even paying extra like
to get it it's probably worth more than
they paid for it yeah it's really
it's a sentimental thing like you you
have to
want that rather than like i don't think
you can depend on that being an
investment and like you're going to sell
later
there's certain companies and certain
styles of products where that clearly
works
and this is a model that you can follow
like the first thousand tesla roadsters
costs more than the rest they're the
founders edition they're going to be
valuable later because they are part of
the first thousand
but that's a company like tesla where
you imagine they'll be around longer and
and even the original tesla roadsters
from back in the day
are more valuable now than they used to
be but i just think when you get more
and more
gadgety and techy that lifespan of
people caring about them
is uh is a little bit weaker i wouldn't
want to be further from tech
i would almost well first off adam just
looked it up on ebay and you can get a
oneplus one for
30 bucks yeah right now so yeah not a
great investment if you there you go
pull that off
um i would almost branch out further
than just
tech i feel like in today's generation
just in general not even just with tech
like collectibles have become
like such a big thing selling old things
uh for tons of money has just become
such a
something everyone looks out for that it
seems like it just doesn't happen as
much anymore
it's really hard to find that but isn't
it usually like new products
i think it's because we we've seen these
like old like
i for instance i think uh like is either
mario 64 like a mario super
nintendo brand new and box just sold for
like
a couple hundred grand i think but but
in the older generations
it's because of how rare they are now
because all those people took them out
and played them and then probably threw
them away by now
we are i mean look at pokemon cards
people are just buying packs and
immediately putting them into sleeves
it's just like
it's not a thing people are playing with
anymore things that are getting
destroyed
which means there's tons of them around
there's no rarity to increase the price
of it so yeah you got to hit this
this this very special combo of being a
rare
classic yeah not easy like
mario obviously you know a classic
exactly most people who had those used
them
so you'd have to have like when we
unboxed that bondi blue
imac that was a rare classic
in great condition that booted up 30
years out the box like that's
that's the type of thing that actually
maybe you can consider more valuable
but i guess if you were betting on
nothing being this huge company in the
future and this being a
classic that's like that's a tough bet
when you're you know a very
new tech company but you know if you
believe in that bit
and you're getting it as an investment
then maybe you do buy one of these or
maybe you just
want the headphones yeah i gotta have
them early i think when you're when
you're selling it as like
basically a collector's item i can only
imagine the person who gets
one out of a hundred on this is going to
never use them and immediately keep them
as a collector i wonder
i would wonder i would guess maybe some
of these first 100s people use
i think it depends on how much they win
the auction for true i would also like
to guess
prices that we think some of these go
for if the top one goes for like 500
bucks
i think they're going to just use them
as headphones because they're just
earbuds like 500 bucks you spent more
you're like wow i got the first ones let
me use them i'm gonna unbox them on
camera and the ceo will retweet me but
if you spent like
10 grand like if it gets crazy on stockx
which it can sometimes
then i would say probably that person is
going to also buy another pair at
general availability and just keep the
one of
100 that they spent 10 grand on and hope
maybe someday it's a classic
i just don't think it's gonna get that
we'll see let's let's guess top bid
and bottom bid i would it would be
really funny if one of the top 100 bids
was under a hundred bucks
so that they actually got it i just
don't think about that that would be
hilarious
from being one of the first hundred um
uh no i think the top
let me go top bid i think someone's
gonna spend
1500 bucks i was gonna go as high as
three thousand
for the number one of a hundred is
that's my guess do you get to
well yeah if you're the highest bid you
get number one of a hundred yeah yeah oh
yeah sorry that's how it works it's not
a hundred individual bids like i thought
it might be it is
you bid for one and the top 100 bids
get the top 100 based on so if you are
the top bid you get one if you are
the 100th top bid you get number 100 so
you don't get to decide you want number
three you just have to hope you're the
third highest bid
yeah which i think is kind of
interesting because
at least in nfts in the sense of like um
like top shot
the number edition was like really
important with the value of it because
ultimately even though maybe you know uh
what numbers lebron so lebron so yeah
lebron will be like jersey number 23 and
they'll sell a hundred of this nft
but the 23rd edition one will be worth
more because it matches his jersey
number right
this one a little different you don't
get to
pick you just like you could really bid
and try and get
in between a certain one but yeah do you
again we're assuming this holds value
afterwards on stockx
this might be known already but is there
public public viewability of all of the
bids
i assume you only see the highest bid
when you're bidding
but this could be different seeing a
different nft sell similarly to this and
it had just the leaderboard of bits
and so it had what number because
i mean if they wanted to make the most
money possible
they probably would not show the last
ones because you're just gonna
the number 100 is just going to be like
a dollar bid over and over like a fight
at the end probably
um yeah i'll be interested to see how it
is i think
lowest bid
[Music]
225 125 125 yeah
that's my okay it's my guess we'll see
we'll see we'll keep an eye on it i
think you might be right on that
we'll link uh we'll check up on this
next episode when we know
but uh let's take a quick break we'll
come back we'll talk about
space
[Music]
this episode of waveform is brought to
you by mini cooper se
so you may or may not know since i try
to be subtle about it i do really enjoy
electric cars
so the mini cooper se is electric it's
charged for the city and ready to spark
up your drive
so it's a zippy little car designed to
be as stylish as the city you drive it
in
and unlike other evs the mini cooper se
doesn't look like it's out of a sci-fi
movie
it still maintains this classic design
that won't look out of place driving
through the streets of new york city
can confirm driving the mini cooper sc
was really fun
because it handles it's a mini it
handles like a go-kart and uh
maneuvering through traffic
safely of course on the way to grab
lunch was a breeze
parking is super easy in a mini so
there's some of the stuff
it is important in new jersey in new
york so it's actually pretty roomy
inside considering andrew and i are both
pretty tall both sitting in the front
seats
two people over six foot plenty of
headroom plenty of foot room
i was pretty happy with that yeah and uh
it gets up to 80
charge in just 35 minutes with fast
charging at level 3
dc charging stations or just charge
overnight at your home with a regular
ac charging outlet plus the electric
digital instrument cluster puts all the
important things right at your
fingertips so it's this unique looking
circular instrument cluster in the
middle of the car makes listening to
your favorite music or podcast in the
morning
as simple as can be plus the lights
around the screen
move as a dial when you adjust things so
if you turn the ac
up it lights up the outside of the
circumference of the dial
we had a lot of fun like trying all the
different things like volume ac
and everything same so that was pretty
cool and it's refreshing actually just
having real knobs inside of a car to
change
mode so that's all there the way it is
in a normal mini cooper so if you're
interested
uh if you're in the market for a compact
stylish quick little car to get you
around the city then it's worth checking
out
the mini cooper se to see if it's right
for you all right so
we're back i have kind of
a lot to teach you i feel like does that
make sense
let's do it okay so i'm sure you saw
like just in general going to space has
been
the topic of headlines everywhere i
think a lot of it has to do with spacex
obviously and elon consistently talking
about
colonizing mars yep what would you say
last five years that's really like blown
off
plenty of time i mean yeah humans need
to be an
interplanetary species that's the that's
the
halo sentence i keep hearing sure yeah
so
that's a little more intense than what
we're about to talk about um but
in this past week a big news headline i
think it was like two or three days ago
was richard branson and virgin galactic
making it to space and i was
peripherally aware that this was
happening i wasn't following it
specifically i was traveling i was
playing ultimate but i think i was in a
restaurant and i saw it on tv
it was just happening somewhere after
branson went to space oh okay
got it cool yeah so the first thing i'm
i'm still struggling what to call this i
like whenever i think about space i want
to call it space
travel but to me that feels like
something more along the lines of like
i'm traveling between places in space
which this is
very much not space tourism tour okay
that's what
that's what we'll call it space tourism
so so i'll explain a little more the
like scientific name of what they're
doing but that's just not fun to say
over and over again okay um
all right so like you i kind of just
peripherally saw this
on i saw it on twitter instead it was
this really cool video
of them like up in space richard branson
and i believe it's
five other crewmates were in space
floating around
looking down on earth you know like the
typical in space thing but but what
really
really like interests me is they showed
footage of
it launching up into the last couple
like miles into the atmosphere
and it was like crazy it looked really
really cool
it kind of reminded me of when we first
saw the spacex rockets like
re-entering and landing upright that
looks surreal it looked
literally fake like cgi and that's what
this kind of looked like so it intrigued
me enough to
dive into a rabbit hole of trying to
figure out what's going on in this kind
of like
we'll call it a modern day space race
because richard branson's not the only
one doing it we all also know about jeff
bezos and blue origin
right going up there was actually a
headline recently about them passing
their last regulations and they will be
launching july 20th so like
we're talking the same month two people
that's pretty
base tourism is jeff personally going
awesome
jeff jeff and his brother are going it's
hilarious yeah
so that's um all that intrigued me i
watched a bunch of videos i read a bunch
of articles
the best one to me was uh from a channel
called everydayastronaut um i'm sure
you've heard of them
if you are a long time fan of the
channel you've probably heard of them
because we
participated in something called project
love day which was shooting a commercial
for tesla he made a great one he made a
fantastic one
yeah he did was he a placement finisher
yes
right he was i i don't know if they did
first second third we
we won i'm still very proud of that
video i liked it a lot i re-watched it
last night um
but if i'm being honest i kind of think
his was the favorite one that we
didn't make
yeah sure i i thought his was fantastic
but he made a
wonderful like 30 minute video comparing
virgin galactic
and blue origin and everything that's
going on i will definitely link it
and their project love day in the show
notes you should check it out um i'm
going to try and do
a much more condensed but still pretty
long explanation of what's going on and
i want to see your
your thoughts i'm not excited all i know
all i know right now is
it's basically a race between these
billionaires to get
to space for bragging rights it is the
billionaire midlife crisis
i think adam described it as and i
thought it was hilarious we're past
corvettes we are now
building spaceships as
your mid-life crisis so a bigger
spaceship so if we get past the point
that these are just a bunch of
billionaires racing to get into space
the rest of it's really interesting
okay sure um okay so
what kind of amazed me is how different
despite
launching in the same month how
different both of these ways of getting
into space are
um and and the big thing here that's
different between spacex which is going
up and bringing people to like the space
station
and literally going into orbit is these
are sub-orbital rides yeah
which is very very different these are
not going high enough to actually get
into orbit hence the name and
while it's still breaking the barrier
into what we consider space
and getting into space it is a very
short ride
into space yeah i think this is where
i'm like
you know it's probably semantics but
like calling it going to space is maybe
a bit
generous like obviously planes are going
up to let's call it 30 000 feet
that's what six miles up something like
that but then you've got you know
other much more higher flying aircraft
military planes other things like that
flying
much much higher in the atmosphere but
they're not in
orbit in space like when i think of in
space i think like the space station
orbiting the earth 250 miles from earth
that's
that's in space so i'll give them that
so there's sort of a couple
like you know lines that have been drawn
where you pass this line what is it 50
something miles so there's something
something called the cameron line which
is like widely known as the start of
space and that's 60 miles
above the earth's surface okay and so
then but you're still not orbiting the
earth you can do a temporary free fall
and have that weightless feeling but
you're not orbiting the earth at that
height so
so they're just getting past that line
just for bragging rights is that what's
happening
sort of all that's one of the key
differences between the two and i'll
explain it um
but uh let's see so that got me a little
off track but i
will get on track here what we're going
to do is i'm just going to kind of
describe both
both of the ships to you so where do we
start then uh i'm going to start with
virgin atlantic they did it first
um also one little note i thought was
funny they weren't supposed to launch
until
august or richard branson wasn't
supposed to go until august i think they
were still doing test flights
and he decided to just go a little
earlier i wonder why
yeah i wonder why jeff bezos is right
around the corner he claims
not for that but like come on also just
admit it i think that'd be
yeah just say it just i want it to be
just i wanted to be and i did
eat it jeff yes just say it okay um all
right so the virgin galactic
spaceship where it is called the
spaceship two unity and i still have a
little confusion here because it's
actually
two separate vehicles um in how they
launch
so i believe the unity is the name of
the vessel that the
pilots and the people are in and the uh
and one thing between these two what's
very different between them is that
these are like
for non-trained like this is for
commercialized
space travel tourism whatever you want
to call it whereas you know
nasa and spacex is much more
like those people are trained to do
stuff you have to be yeah yeah so these
pedestrians can be in this exactly these
are being made
for the commercialized space tourism um
so anyone can get a c
and the plane for virgin galactic is
imagine almost two medium-sized planes
and they're connected at the inside wing
it almost looks like if you had a
catamaran boat i think that's what i saw
on the news
yeah this crazy looking like plane but
it was like three planes connected
it was a very strange site but exactly
and then the one the people and the
pilots are in are is actually like
underneath it in the middle okay so if
it then
takes off it flies to a certain altitude
which i still think was
two or three times the altitude of what
a regular plane
flies at so still very high i think it
is actually
high enough to where you still see the
dark edges around
the earth okay so like that's pretty
impressive and then
this is what got me interested in all of
this there's a video of
the bottom craft it detaches from the
plane as it is flying
falls rocket the thrusters the boosters
whatever you want to call it i'm sure
there's official name that i'm doing
wrong
take off and it just launches past
the the initial docking plane i guess
you would call it okay
and then goes mach 3 i believe three
times the speed of sound
straight up into the air and into space
and it
was it looks like straight out of a
james bond movie it looks like it was
some sci-fi thing like it was another
one of those like the spacex
rockets landing that no part of me
believed it was real
at first yeah um and then essentially
what that accomplishes is
after it detaches launches into space
it gets you just high enough i believe
it's 55 miles above the earth's surface
so not quite the cameron line
and all right let me watch this so
what am i saying describe it also for
audio listeners so i'm seeing the
virgin galactic plane go up it does
really look like
two planes attached to each other which
is pretty funny
oh there goes your speed 600 miles an
hour 2000 miles an hour all right this
thing is
popped out of the bottom of the plane
and is now rocketing to 30
000 feet that doesn't seem
i don't think that is okay now they're
sub
orbital falling yeah that part is cool
i like that you still can feel this
you can feel zero g which is which is
obviously super cool
but also the fact that you're so far out
of
the normal atmosphere that you can see
the curvature of the earth and you can
see the spheres around
you you're definitely high enough that
you're seeing the space around earth so
that's what i think is like the big
difference here kind of between
what you're talking about like there's
no there's no other airplane that's
getting that high and what it actually
does is
it launches itself straight up and then
if
the wings it almost looks like a paper
airplane with the wings it has these
like
very flat wings that go all the way to
the back and those
turn and then use um air compression
to actually flip it kind of upside down
so then you're looking back at earth
because it has windows above the seats
that's smart and then for
here's the kicker it's only about three
to four minutes that you're in space
you unbuckle yourself you experience
weightlessness for a couple minutes they
have these
really cool windows that have like
handles on them so you can you know grab
yourself because you're floating around
once you're unbuckled
uh grab yourself look out the window
check out earth
um for four minutes buckle back in and
then because it looks like kind of a
small
private plane then you come back down
and you just kind of
coast like a regular plane and land
totally normally on a uh
an airstrip honestly that sounds pretty
fun it does that sounds pretty fun
so what is sanao the jeff or the jeff
blue bezos blue origin version how is
that different
very different so the ship it is the
blue origin new shepard is the name of
the ship
and it is much more similar to what we
expect as like a regular like
nasa rocket a rocket a rocket it is yeah
and i i always get kind of confused
about the rocket engine i
believe is the large standing booster
that sends the thing into space and
generally comes back
down to earth what's cool about this
is essentially the passenger capsule is
on top of the rocket so imagine a rocket
with maybe a little more of a
circular top because that's where we're
putting the passengers again this is six
people that can fit in here okay the
difference here is that it's fully
autonomous
so in the other one you need two pilots
interesting this is fully autonomous
anyone in there doesn't need any
training on how to land this capsule
okay so first i i think that sounds kind
of freaky it sounds
terrifying because they're like what if
something goes wrong who's gonna save us
but okay
there are a lot of really cool safety
measures that i don't remember
everything about them so i would check
out the video if you get a chance
yeah but um it's basically just this
circular table
or not even a table a circular like ring
of seats looking at what is actually the
largest windows to ever go to space i
think that's pretty cool which makes
total sense in like a tourism consumer
fashion
rocket launches up straight into the air
when it gets to its peak the capsule
detaches
throws you up around 62 miles in the air
so this is
over the official cameron line which is
definitely a bragging right although
because the other one richard branson's
did not cross the line i didn't cross
the cameron line
technically but from everything i've
read most scientists agree that there's
almost no concernable difference between
the two when you're at that point
i'm sure the difference between 55 miles
and 75 miles
above earth is it's like when you're
starting to lose scale
exactly it's very far both of them but
okay yeah um so
that does bragging rights to uh blue
origin you're making it over the cameron
line
exactly um again though three to four
minutes you get up there you can
unbuckle you can float around
and then what happens here is you start
floating you descend you descend
three parachutes come out you float back
down into the desert of texas
and then a bunch of air compressors
shoot out at the bottom to make it like
a really smooth landing which i thought
was actually really neat because
these thrusters do so like exert so much
power to even you out
actually when you look at it it looks
like it's impacting really hard because
dust is flying everywhere but that's
from the booster
yeah um so much that if two of the
parachutes were to fail
it would still get you down without
life-threatening injuries which
probably still means it's pretty
impactful but you're not dying but yeah
um
good backup but yeah another just
capsule you float up in the air
uh three to four minutes space again
pretty cool i guess so here's a question
here's my question for you
is three to four minutes worth it
well i guess we need the dollar value do
you want the dollar value because
oh we have that virgin galactic sold 600
reservations already
okay so what how much is that that's
it's very expensive take a guess okay
well uh i'm gonna go with uh
ten grand a seat
two hundred and fifty thousand two
hundred
fifty thousand dollars so i guess the
novelty of these
early tickets is you're one of the first
yes so less than a thousand people have
been up that high
just that's that's the novelty ever
that's what you're paying for yeah
that's exactly what you're paying for
okay actually if you want to even go a
crazier price which is totally
not comparable blue origin doesn't have
a price yet i don't believe they've
taken reservations they've done a ton of
test flights and this one coming up will
be the first time
anyone's in it it's jeff bezos his
brother i don't know the other but
apparently one other
seat was sold for them and it was like
26 million dollars
but this is you're going up with jeff
bezos and like all that so i'm sure
clearly another oh man billionaire
probably dollars per minute that's
hilarious
per minute oh that's the other thing
though is the total flight trip of blue
origin is probably is like 10 to 15
minutes because you're just
launching up and you're coming straight
back down yeah the total round trip for
virgin galactic is closer to two hours
because it takes you
so long to ascend to that initial launch
point
and then you're flying the whole way
back down
so in some cases it's maybe like all
right i have more time to experience
everything honestly honestly when i'm
hearing this described i think the
the the virgin galactic one sounds
better like as an experience like i'm
not gonna do this anytime soon most of
us
probably would but if i'm imagining like
all right
i want i have this crazy amount of money
i want to blow on the novelty of going
to space
um both of them are going to give you
three to four minutes of
in space weightlessness space tourism
that whole experience
but i think the uh flying up in an
airplane part will probably be more
comfortable than a rocket launch yeah i
actually
they didn't talk much about about like
the initial thrusting and everything
yeah
like i i feel like i've seen enough
rocket launchers to know that's that's a
very different experience than
flying up on a plane flying i've flown
in a plane it's you know
maybe that's a little more comfortable
but then
but then yeah just having that that
crazy
three to four minutes and then it's over
and then you just have to remember that
forever maybe they'll record it like a
disney world ride oh my god and then
what charge you ten thousand dollars
yeah you spent 20 mil on the tickets so
you got another 500 grand for this video
of you oh my god
um yeah wow well i
so in the future someday like really far
in the future
yeah this will be just another theme
park attraction
right that's the goal is you want to be
able to do space tourism
commercially viably repeatedly often for
everyone like let's make space a
curiosity that anyone can
check out go to the zoo one day go to
disney world one day go to space one day
i don't know how far in the future that
is but that's
something i'm optimistic about and like
hoping i get to do someday and i hope
like you know everyone gets to everyone
as many people as possible get to try
out
but uh yeah it's as you know as long as
today a
a you know a plane ticket costs 100 200
bucks then i feel like that's about as
low as you can go for a
flight to space yeah i don't think we'll
see a hundred two hundred dollars in
space in our lifetime but um
i think you you did mention something
that i didn't talk about that i think is
really important is you said
you know doing this consistently all of
this is reusable like
the the planes are obviously the blue
origin since it's a rocket engine it's
similar to spacex and where it can
it lands itself again and they've done
like 12 trial runs and it's worked every
time
it actually has enough thrust
to get to the point of hovering before
it lands so it actually lands
softer than falcon the difference is
falcon is
massively bigger than blue origin yeah
well
falcon's not landing with the people
still on it is it no yeah yeah
um but still much much different scale
size but uh that's pretty awesome
and then for those of you this is like
my main thing when i think
why clearly space is an interesting idea
but when i originally thought why it's
like
that is a lot of fuel is it worth just
like
throw like blowing emissions out to just
like
go into space for four minutes i have
good news and bad news
virgin galactic is just using like
pretty
standard fuel and has a lot of emissions
blue origin is using
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen so it
has almost no emission
wow i believe so at least it is the much
greener option out of the two if that
changes your mind at all and that's
the largest windows and in space that
part is really cool i think it's for me
maybe uh i've seen too many failed
rocket landings to where like if i could
have a horizontal takeoff and a
horizontal landing i'd prefer that like
you said 12 tests
and like i hear you oh no trust me i'm
not getting in either of these
anytime but you tell me like all right
they've done this rocket it's launched
12 times in a row and it's been great
all 12 times so you want to get on the
13th one
no not really oh yeah i've seen a lot
more successful
flights like take off hardly if i'm
being honest if i could pick anyone
right now it would just be if i could
somehow get on the plane that launches
the virgin galactic and just
getting to that you know about three
times higher than a regular commercial
plane seeing the dark edges and i think
i would be pretty
down with that we were talking about the
concord a little while ago about how
that plane was supersonic and i have to
go higher than normal in the atmosphere
because it's thinner up there
it would go way higher and go across the
atlantic in like two hours and land and
that was crazy but
yeah i just i want to see i want to see
the curvature of the earth
and a little bit of that that edge of
the atmosphere type space that would be
it would be awesome um cool i have one
more question for you okay
we we obviously see spacex talking about
going to mars and everything like that
and elon seems very interested in space
in fact i think he may have already
booked a flight on one of these um i
think the virgin galactic
but um do you think spacex ever
looks at this route of like consumer
space tourism or are they just gonna be
full-blown on the like
we're trying to colonize mars we're
trying to get into space
do you think spacex is going to go this
tourism route or more
focused on their mission of you know
intergalactic
it's a good question yeah from what i
can tell
that is the mission okay is um i kind of
think so
yeah making reusable rockets where you
when you inevitably
need to take a flight to mars and
obviously you you get the boosters
to get you out of the atmosphere and out
of orbit and then you bring the boosters
back down like you need to get
a lot of stuff to mars a lot of people a
lot of cargo
and so to be able to reuse those rockets
over and over again like that's the
thing that they're trying to solve
and i think maybe a consequence of the
technology getting good
enough is you are able to also bring
people to space
and make these cool you know suborbital
flights for space tourism and that's
pretty neat and that satisfies a lot of
the curiosity
that we're interested in i'm sure neil
degrasse tyson would be pumped about it
but uh i still think yeah the the
primary
mission of improving rockets
and making them reusable is to
eventually
be able to move things to other planets
and to other places and then humans are
interplanetary and then everybody's
happy
but again this is all like a will any of
this happen in our lifetime type thing
like i don't know i want to be
optimistic
maybe when your grandkids are keeping
waveform going in like
200 years they can talk about it that
would be cool
we'll see that'd be cool um yeah so i
think last thing on there is if you
really want like a way more in-depth
video on this
uh everyday astronaut great channel has
a lot of cool stuff on this and
obviously we'll probably be making a ton
of content because blue origin launches
in like two weeks
yeah yeah so i'm ex i'm really excited
to then see
that launch as well and see some video
from up there and kind of compare the
two
because it's really awesome that we live
in an age with such great cameras that
we kind of get to experience it with
them
100 all right let's take a quick break
we'll come back and we got to talk about
one last thing which is uh the hot take
we mentioned at the beginning
we'll see how it goes this episode of
waveform is brought to you by
sennheiser so while the truly wireless
earbud market is uh really exploding
over the past couple years i feel like
no one has really put
high quality sound as their first
priority but sennheiser has changed that
with their momentum
true wireless 2. now we've all tested a
bunch of headphones here
do you have a go-to song you listen to
when you do
you plug in headphones for the first
time what are you what are you trying i
mean we get a lot of headphones here so
yeah
um i think i have to go with
ever since i started listening to dead
mouse let go
it's just like he has so many different
instruments and synths and stuff that he
uses that i feel like when i'm using
better headphones i really start hearing
like little things out like so that's my
fun one
yeah that i hadn't heard before i know
how i know exactly how ongoing thing
sounds like every pair of headphones um
sennheiser has always been a go-to when
it comes to
audio equipment for the channel i've
tested everything from the the
hd6xx to the hda20s that i've edited
with i've always loved how focused they
are on delivering the best
quality sound possible uh so sennheiser
always puts their sound first so these
new momentum
true wireless twos deliver the best
listening experience
and they have been finely crafted for
even the most discerning listener of
earbuds
so you can customize them with the free
smart control app
and adjust the sound to your personal
preference with the built-in equalizer
and you can also switch off your
surroundings and dive deep into that
impactful sound
because there is active noise
cancellation in these as well and the
momentum true wireless 2 also have a 28
hour total battery life
with the case so you never have to worry
you'll be able to last a whole day with
these
and uh if you're looking for something
other than earbuds sennheiser actually
has
over-ear headphones and sound bars and
all kinds of stuff for your audio needs
i can't say i'm surprised cnn called
these the earbuds to get if you value
sound quality over everything else
because
that's what i would say too so why
settle for anything other than
great sound come hear the difference
with the sennheisers
right now for my first hundred listeners
who go to cenazer.com
podcast and use promo code waveform uh
you'll get
15 off the momentum true wireless two
earbuds or any other
sennheiser's amazing headphones so
that's 15 off when you go to
s e n n h e i
s e r dot com slash podcast and use
promo code
waveform all right welcome back to our
new segment
introducing the hot takes segment we're
your hosts
uh that's all this far i got with the
intro
wonderful but we'll workshop that i
think it'll be fun basically
uh the tech world is full of hot takes
and we always have random
you know things that we were thinking
but we don't really
say but also maybe other people are
thinking them too and we'll just put
them out there and see how it goes
um my i'm starting off kind of spicy
with my hot take and we've got
i don't you you don't have any hot i
couldn't think of one i might have to
borrow some i think adam's got a couple
over there though so we'll let him toss
a few out
we'll have him we'll borrow some of
those but let's just uh let's just dive
right in because i want to see
how far this gets before i end up either
canceling myself or we'll see
we'll see all right number one i'm gonna
start with uh we were talking earlier
about
uh celsius and fahrenheit yeah so this
is my
this isn't even my hot take this is
something i saw on twitter and thought
about and i was like yeah you know what
i agree with that
that yes the u.s should
move to metric but okay
fahrenheit is better for weather
and that will be the reason we don't
that will be
oh okay yeah there's a lot to impact
there because that didn't start off that
was like
cold so i think yeah we can all agree we
should probably go to metric right right
right the imperial system is insane we
have feet we have
all these weird like degrees fahrenheit
versus like ounces and all these crazy
things we don't really
gowns versus liters all these terrible
and we're not even that consistent with
it like
soda is sold in liters but milk is sold
in gallons
gallons gasolines and gallons versus
fluid ounces
like i'm asking google for conversions
all the time i would love to switch to
wait wait can i throw out just a little
gripe i have that's really relevant
right now
google home when i ask you to convert
something
just tell me the freaking conversion i
don't need to know how to convert it i
bought you for a reason
please just say yes that is you like one
cup is equal to
x amount of grams you have to ask it the
perfect way or it'll go
i don't want to that's its job that's
not my job it's not paying me money to
learn how to do it
okay anyway yeah so my my thing is
fahrenheit and just the the scale that
we use for weather this isn't even for
anything else like water boils at 32 or
freezes at 32 but boils at 212 in
fahrenheit like there's
it's a weird system but uh for weather
humans are very sensitive to temperature
change and there is a real difference
between
68 and 72 and
you know obviously decimals aren't the
hardest thing in the world to get
but that was the one argument i saw on
twitter which is like
if we could just use fahrenheit just for
weather just to go from like
our you know negative 10 or whatever to
105 degrees
that that granularity it's right there
in the system itself you don't have to
use decimals
nearly as often that's the reason i
think
fahrenheit so stubbornly stays and if
you keep
fahrenheit for degrees then i guess you
got to keep fahrenheit for all
temperature measurement instead of just
weather you also now measure like water
boiling and
all the other things now we're just
stuck on imperial forever so
i think i think because of how great
fahrenheit is for weather
we're stuck i still that's my hot tub i
kind of
understand your point in that like
if there's a difference between the like
generally four degrees
in like you know 68 to 72
i don't know if i really buy that that
much i don't think there's much
i i will agree if i look on the weather
and it says
70 if it says a number in the 70s versus
number in the 60s like that to me
i'm happier i don't know if i go outside
and i generally
feel the difference all that much i
still think it gets confusing though
where it's like
snow at 32 degrees not at zero
yeah i mean we're clearly not hitting
boiling yet i mean we're well on our way
to getting boiling outside but um
i don't know i sound like such a
fahrenheit stand but let's
listen temperature like think about like
grades you get in school
like the difference between a b between
a b and a b plus no oh really it's like
84
is a b such a different 85 is a b then
86 is a b
plus like why did we go from 85 to 86
being b
to b plus you'd rather have a b plus
than a b and that difference
is one and that's like a zero to 100
scale our temperature that we live in
here is generally a zero to 100 scale
sometimes it's a little below zero or a
little above 100 but generally that's
where we're living
like the granularity in that perfect set
of numbers
just from zero to 100 is what makes
fahrenheit
great everywhere else it sucks yeah
everywhere else it sucks
i'll give you this if it were a
if we were in a bubble and the only
thing that would change
if i could only pick fahrenheit versus
celsius and nothing else like really
mattered like
sure i'll pick fahrenheit over celsius
because it's a tad bit
nicer but if we're just talking there it
is agreed if we're talking about the
whole thing like i would rather change
everything to metrics and then get
celsius and of course
do away with fahrenheit and be like oh
no it's
60 or it's 20.5
degrees celsius yeah i just remember
like changing the degrees in the car
would be like 19.5
20 20.5 i'm like that's interesting it's
going by 0.5
whereas like i'm just going by the car
argument might be a better argument if
you want to make that
i think because like if i'm in a lot of
cars now the temperature gauge it's not
just you know
red and blue it's like you're doing an
actual number and when i'm picking a
number
i'm picking sometimes i am just going
down two degrees fahrenheit
yeah so like that that's probably i
think that's the better way of like
air conditioning air conditioning
temperatures there is a very small range
of air conditioning temperatures you
might go from
65 fahrenheit to 75 fahrenheit that
at least in this region in the u.s like
65 to 75 fahrenheit is
10 fahrenheit degrees which is probably
about 5
celsius degrees so now you're doing
anyway this is all nitpicking
i would much rather have everything go
metric and accept
the one downside of celsius being less
accurate in the middle
i'm tired of feeling like an idiot going
to other countries just not
understanding
anything at all yeah i mean that's
mostly on me but if i can blame it on
the us i would prefer to blame it on
someone else oh school systems
all right adam yeah it's hot take time
okay are you ready to potentially have
both of us go out oh i'm ready bring it
on okay
okay my hot take is foldable phones are
not the future
foldable phones and do you have a reason
or it's just uh not feeling it
i think that they're gonna be very niche
in the way that like the note series for
the galaxies were niche but most people
are not gonna wanna deal with
one extra step before getting to their
phone i think by the time that foldable
phones are
ready quote-unquote there's gonna be a
different form factor that we're all
using
you know what's funny i actually don't
think that's a hot take damn
i think that's probably what most people
also think they see a folding phone
i agree i think it's funny because i'm i
i'd consider myself
pretty optimistic where i think if the
tech gets good enough
that folding in half is just one more
feature i've said this before
then maybe people will just get the
folding version
and it's just a no-brainer but that is a
lot of assumptions
that's that's a lot of tech that has to
improve to make that possible
i would go i don't think folding phones
are in the next 10 years are going to be
anything more than
super niche um i think if they do get to
a point
so your main argument i feel like is the
extra step
we're seeing the outside screens where
like in general they should be just as
capable as your regular
candy bar phone right now um the problem
is they're super thick and they're just
not
like we're not at that point yeah we're
actually the first full that was
terrible that was the first one yes so
we're in like
generations generations two and three
right now so if we're going the next 10
years imagine it gets better the next
one and the next one and the next one
and the next one
and the cameras get better and the
screens get better and the batteries get
thinner and everything about every
single component that makes them too
thick right now
or a little too unwieldy right now all
the hinges get smoother
everything gets better for eight more
generations in a row
will that still not be good enough don't
know
i'm optimistic i think it has to reach
that point
and has to reach that point with a price
point that's
competitive prices and everything else
yeah yeah price of the future um
yeah i don't know yeah i don't think so
i don't think even if everything got
perfect i still don't think do you have
a
guess at what the different form factor
might be because i i love this question
we've had this conversation before
and i really enjoy people thinking about
different form factors of phones
so this is going to be very boring but i
think we have the perfect form factor
already
yeah just a slab of glass and i think
about that a lot yeah when you see a
future a movie that takes place in the
future
they inevitably just have like a candy
bar factor form factor thing with like a
projection at best
i was gonna say i is the new form factor
essentially like a projection
or even like a almost like a
non-physical thing like let's imagine
google glass in the future
where now you are seeing your phone in a
viewpoint that only you can see
and like you know hand movements or
something is what's actually doing the
typing
well that's that's more than 10 years
because like who cares about who cares
about a screen that can fold to be
six inches when you can have a screen
that's 60 inches that only you can see
i think there's going to be a lot of
that but i think that the main hub
of all of the computing that's going on
is still going to be the phone
in your pocket yeah i agree i think i
think i've
i consider myself short-sighted when i
think that
but i i can't help but think that so i
would still call it a hot take though i
think there's a lot of people that would
disagree with that
and i just we'll see about those
comments yeah i'm actually really
interested in people
if people on our discord in the podcast
uh discussion section i would really
like to hear your opinions because
i kind of do i don't know i think
they're going to be a thing
eventually i just think we're way
farther than we think it might not be a
hot take but it's a slow burn
slow burn yeah all right hit us with
another one
all right another one garmin makes the
best smart watches
that is a hot take i i would say
now i've never i've never used a garmin
smartwatch
but when you say the best smartwatch my
brain immediately goes to apple watch so
now you have to kind of probably qualify
best smartwatch overall or best
smartwatch
that isn't for the iphone i would argue
best smartwatch overall
because even with apple devices the only
thing that people
genuinely care about is notifications
and health features
and garmin is just as good if not better
with health features
and the higher end models which are
super expensive also handle
notifications very well
they just don't plug into iphone the way
that the apple watch does for obvious
reasons
i think that's maybe the reason the
apple watch has such a strong foothold
and i think the reason the apple watch
is the most popular watch in the world
isn't because it's like
you know technically better than the
garmin's
but it does plug into the iphone user
in a way that none others can and it's
almost unfair that that's what makes it
the best smartwatch
but that's a big part of why it's the
best smartwatch popular or best
both it is the most popular because it
is the best option and i also think
aesthetics might be a little of a
underrated thing since it is
technically a fashion accessory a lot of
people do you think it goes in favor of
in favor of the appalachia
i would argue the exact opposite i would
argue
the majority of people who enjoy and i'm
sure adam consists
he's a watch person that's true if you
are a watch person the apple watch is
not something you're excited to get
but how many how many humans on earth
are large people
uh watch person there are
there are a lot i mean you can be a
watch person without being like a
rolex like expensive watching person
like
but watches just in general like in
terms of the fashion accessory that they
are
and like if we're talking about wearing
a watch with like a suit or something
like that or as a like
kind of dress up fashion apple watch
doesn't quite
hit that where sure regular watches do
and garmin watches are closer to that
now i
also have a garmin watch that i would
not consider like
really looking that much like a normal
watch because it's a very standard
version of it but i do
love it for the health features that it
has i'll only really wear it when i'm
working out
um it's fine i think the one adam has is
much much nicer than i have and it looks
like it just looks like a watch that's
what watches look like these days
i think you might i think i could agree
with that the garmin watch is a better
smart watch for some people
but i think the apple watch
is actually for a lot of iphone users
the best
available overall smart watch for iphone
use well so here's the thing
there's a lot of people and i also think
in terms of most popular
if you are looking at a garmin watch to
buy and you're not 100
sold on it already you're looking at
other companies that make things that
are similar
if you are in the market for just a
smart watch and you only have one option
apple watch doesn't have competitors in
my eyes because the people who
an apple watch works for it doesn't have
a
competition really yeah does that mean
it's the best
you could probably argue that yeah yeah
well i mean that they're saying
it's because iphones are very popular i
gotta try one
that is a hot tape i do i'll i'll end it
with this i need to try a garmin
smartwatch because i have not tried one
yet if you want to go into a lot of good
looking ones because i
do believe also there are a lot of ones
that also have the secondary
uh like monitors that you can hook up if
you're trying to get like really intense
uh yeah because most body measurements
and stuff like that most of what i use
most of what i use to watch for is the
health features
meaning fitness tracking and that sort
of thing uh
time and notifications and then sort of
like a
once in a while i'll be like what's the
weather on my watch or i'll ask siri
something but that's very rare so
yeah i'm gonna try one of those out
garmin definitely has everything you
were just talking about sweet
all right maybe one more one more more
hot
tape do you have any more i have another
one what's the spiciest available
remaining tape
the spiciest one i have is clubhouse
will be back it is not done
interesting i think it is with a new
with a new like feature is that how it
comes back really i just think everyone
kind of wrote it off already as a social
media thing that flopped and failed it
was just a pandemic kind of
thing i think they're not done yet i
think they're going to come back
here's one thing i actually saw someone
i used to work with who is not in the
tech world at all
posting that they were hosting a
clubhouse just to like talk about
something they were interested in and i
was like
this is not where i was expecting to see
clubhouse talk yeah it pops up
once in a while yeah yeah i i thought
that was really interesting it's
definitely broken into the mainstream
which is sometimes for us tech people is
hard to like
really remember that there's not nerds
out there
well this is what happens the way i
observe clubhouse was it was ios only
and i i pay attention to numbers so i
was looking at like how many people that
i follow were actually using it in
hosting rooms i think i
when it was iphone only i think i had
about 30 000
uh followers on clubhouse oh wow and
i i slowly stopped using it i kept
getting notifications from it so i was
like
you know i could see when it was being
used by people i followed
and then one day i just checked back
after android joined and i think i have
300 000 followers on clubhouse so when
you say broke into the mainstream
i just think it became much more widely
available and whenever that happens it's
it drops a little bit of the allure of
like how
cool it was and that's like a very vain
thing like it doesn't actually matter
yeah but now it's like it is much more
used now than it ever has been but not
in that in the same hype
type of way where like elon was dropping
into random clubhouses when's the last
time that happened
um the the most popular show that i
follow on clubhouse the good times
uh i guess it's sort of a podcast
basically uh you know had mr beast on
and had
you know addison ray on and had all
kinds of these really interesting people
on and i
haven't really heard about any of these
lately and maybe it's because i'm not
paying enough attention but
i'd be curious what clubhouse coming
back
looks like i guess what i'm saying when
i when i said mainstream
it's like all of what you said you know
mr beast and
addison ray aren't tech people but
they're still like in this creator
community kind of thing like people who
follow
social platforms and like the person i
saw was just someone i
used to work in a restaurant with that
just like is not attached to
any of these and this was recent it was
like last week yeah
and hosting a clubhouse room and posting
about it on facebook
and probably not getting a ton of people
but just like even if they're just
trying stuff like that i'm assuming
they're getting a couple
and like that does kind of feel like
it's hitting a small
social platform the early stages of it
but
it's a good yeah it's a good anecdotal
indicator
i just don't know it's about as
anecdotal as you yeah i don't know i
i remember zuckerberg get a room and
like i don't know
i just that sort of thing it's been a
while since i've seen
that kind of stuff so i wonder if they
what
what would it take for clubhouse to come
back is my real question is it going to
be
some big social push is it going to be
some
big event that happens on clubhouse do
you have a specific reasoning as to why
you think it's going to come back my
reasoning is very optimistic i'm kind of
looking at it the same way that
the same thing that happened to snapchat
where snapchat came out with stories
instagram copied them everything has
stories now but snapchat still carved
out a niche where it's killing it
and i think clubhouse is gonna be the
same thing but for audio
where they can keep innovating and being
creative with audio features
they're going to have that niche audio
audience
i think that's possible because if you
consider snapchat's current state a
success i think clubhouse can
can do that snapchat hated success by
pivoting
essentially though because like their
big thing now is ar
and like bitmoji is something they have
a bunch of shows and
they still do stuff they are not good
i'm just saying they do them
a show on snapchat like that might be
one of the dumber things
i've heard of but that's because we're
not in the target audience they are men
it's
very true massive um so yeah
yeah i guess i i would i can see that
being something similar but then they
would have to create
some sort of special specialized
something for audio that changes the
industry and
they might i mean clubhouse changed the
industry already
and it has a million competitors um it
birthed all of its competitions
yeah yeah interesting i like that one
yeah we'll see we'll check back in in a
year and see how wrong i was we'll see
i want to leave we still haven't used
clubhouse oh well i'm going to bring it
back
we're bringing it you can now we're not
bringing it back i'm going to leave this
question with people at the end because
i think i feel like you can tweet at us
or let us know in the comments section
is clubhouse a feature
or a social network is it an entire
thing i think we've we've sort of
dabbled in this but let us know what you
actually think the answer is in the
comments because at this point it's
clear that
lots of other companies believe it's a
feature and that they can just build
into their app
and then there it is they've done it
they've done what they had to do
but clubhouse by itself could have
something to it so let us know what you
think
in the comments i can just say if i were
a clubhouse i would have sold out like
immediately and just
made a ton of money and then never sold
to linkedin i would
actually clubhouse would work really
good on linkedin that sounds like the
perfect place for a bunch of
that is pretty funny hustle gurus to
just like spew nonsense for a while
there it is there's my hot take there's
our first round of hot takes
i thought that was a fun segment i'm
really i'm kind of bummed i didn't think
of one but i will definitely think of
one for next time we have this segment
we'll bring it back yeah bring it back
well any of the case we'll be back next
week
we've got a bunch more exciting stuff
coming up
an exciting video i'm hoping to drop
pretty soon and maybe an exciting car
will be in our hands soon so we'll see
about all that
by next week but in either case make
sure you're subscribed if you haven't
already been
on youtube and anywhere you listen and
we'll catch you guys
